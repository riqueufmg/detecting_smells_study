{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FloatConstant.ConstantPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While the Implementation class has many dependencies, the ConstantPool class itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
