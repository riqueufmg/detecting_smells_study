    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.utility.StreamDrainer' has incoming dependencies from 10 other classes and no outgoing dependencies. The high number of incoming dependencies (>= 5 is typically considered high) indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, making it a central point in the system. This pattern of having numerous incoming dependencies with no outgoing dependencies characterizes Hub-like Modularization, as it acts as a hub that other components rely on."
