    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, TypeDescription, and AnnotationList, which are relatively few and focused. There is no evidence of excessive dependencies either incoming or outgoing that would indicate hub-like modularization."
