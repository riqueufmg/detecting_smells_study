    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'HashCodeMethod' has outgoing dependencies to 19 other classes, including nested classes, and interacts with a wide variety of abstractions across different packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription', 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatchers', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender', 'net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.InstrumentedType', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class is highly connected, acting as a hub that coordinates interactions between many other components. Additionally, it defines several nested classes (e.g., 'NoOp', 'ForSuperMethodCall', 'ForStaticTypeHash', 'ForDynamicTypeHash', 'ValueTransformer', 'NullValueGuard', 'OffsetProvider'), which also contribute to its central role and complexity, further supporting the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
