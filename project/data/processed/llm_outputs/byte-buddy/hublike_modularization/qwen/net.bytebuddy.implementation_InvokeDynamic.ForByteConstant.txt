    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForByteConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForByteConstant' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. While 'TypeDescription' itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on those, and it does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
