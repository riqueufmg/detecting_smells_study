    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, FilterableList, and ByteCodeElement, which are direct and limited in number. None of these dependencies exhibit a large number of further dependencies that would indicate hub-like behavior. The class does not act as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
