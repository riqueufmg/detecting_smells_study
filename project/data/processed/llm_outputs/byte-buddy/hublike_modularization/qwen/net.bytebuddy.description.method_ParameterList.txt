    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ParameterList' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 34 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ParameterList' acts as a hub, connecting numerous other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
