    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyAnnotationDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to core classes in related packages (type, method, pool, annotation). While some of these dependency targets have extensive internal dependencies, the class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of different abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions."
