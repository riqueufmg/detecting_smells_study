    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodDescription.InDefinedShape' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct classes: 'TypeDescription', 'TypeDefinition', 'MethodDescription', 'JavaDispatcher', 'AccessControllerPlugin', and 'ParameterDescription'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'MethodDescription', indicating that it is a central point of interaction. The class interacts with a large number of abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
