    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.NoOp' has no outgoing dependencies and is only depended upon by one class, 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which is its enclosing class. It does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
