    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.FrameComputingClassWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (TypePool and TypeDescription), which in turn have a large number of outgoing dependencies each (TypePool has 64 dependencies and TypeDescription has 58 dependencies). This creates a hub-like modularization where the analyzed class is connected to a large number of other abstractions through these dependencies."
