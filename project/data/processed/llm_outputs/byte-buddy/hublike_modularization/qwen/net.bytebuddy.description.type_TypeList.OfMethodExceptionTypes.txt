    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.OfMethodExceptionTypes' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypeList', 'TypeDescription', and 'CachedReturnPlugin'. The incoming dependency is from 'TypeList'. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a high number of dependencies with other abstractions."
