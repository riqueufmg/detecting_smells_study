    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Dispatcher and ForLegacyGradle) and 1 incoming dependency (JavaConventionConfiguration). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
