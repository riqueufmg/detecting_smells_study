{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForExplicitMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Although MethodDescription itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class 'MethodCall.ForExplicitMethod' does not directly depend on those. The low number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that this class is not hub-like in its modularization."
