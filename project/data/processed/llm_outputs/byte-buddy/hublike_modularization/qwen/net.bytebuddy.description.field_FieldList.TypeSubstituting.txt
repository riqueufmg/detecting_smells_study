    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'FieldDescription' and 'TypeDescription', which themselves have numerous dependencies, but the class in question does not directly depend on those numerous dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
