    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FieldConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldConstant' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes: TypeDescription, Implementation, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, FieldDescription, and ClassConstant. Additionally, the outgoing dependencies reveal that the dependent classes themselves have numerous further dependencies (e.g., TypeDescription has 60+ dependencies, Implementation has 30+, etc.), indicating that FieldConstant interacts with a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This pattern of extensive outgoing dependencies, combined with the complexity of the depended-upon classes, constitutes Hub-like Modularization."
