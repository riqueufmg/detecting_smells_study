    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaDispatcher' has outgoing dependencies to 16 other classes and is referenced by 98 other classes through incoming dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'JavaDispatcher' acts as a hub, connecting a large number of abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
