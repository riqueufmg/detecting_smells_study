    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ArrayAccess' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The total number of dependencies (10) is high, indicating that this class acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies characterizes Hub-like Modularization."
