{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.ClassConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ClassConstant class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions (ClassFileVersion, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, Implementation, StackManipulation, StackSize) and incoming dependencies from 5 other abstractions (FixedValue, MethodCall, FieldConstant, MethodConstant, Binder). This creates a hub-like structure where ClassConstant is central to many dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, making it a hub-like modularization smell."
