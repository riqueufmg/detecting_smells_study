    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.FieldAccess.Defined",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class FieldAccess. The incoming dependencies list shows only one source class with 10 dependencies, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies from multiple abstractions. Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not present here."
