    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Context",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.Context' has outgoing dependencies to 19 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 1 other abstraction. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both within its own package and across other packages. This extensive dependency pattern, where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions, is indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
