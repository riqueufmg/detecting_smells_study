    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedExecutableExceptionType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Although JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class only directly depends on these two abstractions, which is not a large number. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
