    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.Factory' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct classes: 'net.bytebuddy.ClassFileVersion', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader', 'net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader', 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', and 'net.bytebuddy.build.AccessControllerPlugin'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter', which itself depends on 13 other classes. This pattern of having numerous both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub within the module, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions."
