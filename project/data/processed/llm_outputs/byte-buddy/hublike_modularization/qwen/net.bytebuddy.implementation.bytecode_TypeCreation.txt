    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.TypeCreation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeCreation' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 classes: StackManipulation, Implementation, TypeDescription) and only 2 incoming dependencies (ClassVisitorFactory and SerializedConstant). The dependencies are not extensive enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class does not act as a central hub connecting to many other components in the system."
