    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall.TerminationHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from SuperMethodCall class. The incoming dependency shows SuperMethodCall uses this class along with 7 other classes/types, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for this specific class since we're analyzing it in isolation. The class itself does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
