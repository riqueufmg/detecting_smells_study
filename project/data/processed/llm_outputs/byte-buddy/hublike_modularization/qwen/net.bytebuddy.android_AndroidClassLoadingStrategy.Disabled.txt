    "class": "net.bytebuddy.android.AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.Disabled",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from AndroidClassLoadingStrategy, which is its enclosing class. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, as it only interacts with its parent class and is not a hub connecting multiple unrelated components."
