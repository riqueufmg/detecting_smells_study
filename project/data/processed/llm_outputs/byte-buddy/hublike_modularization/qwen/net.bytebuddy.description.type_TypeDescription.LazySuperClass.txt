    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin' and no incoming dependencies. The dependency itself has multiple outgoing dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class, as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing)."
