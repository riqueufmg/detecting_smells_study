{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.ConstructorComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from MethodList and MethodList.ForLoadedMethods, and no outgoing dependencies. The low number of dependencies (only 7 total unique classes involved) does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
