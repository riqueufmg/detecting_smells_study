    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its parent class AndroidClassLoadingStrategy, which is a normal parent-child relationship. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
