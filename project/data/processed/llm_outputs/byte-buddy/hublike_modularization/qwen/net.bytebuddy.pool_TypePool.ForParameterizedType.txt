    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForParameterizedType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForParameterizedType' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypePool', 'TypeVariableSource', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'TypeList'. The incoming dependencies come only from 'TypePool'. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
