    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.UnresolvedAnnotationList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to AnnotationList and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like behavior. A hub-like modularization smell requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not present here."
