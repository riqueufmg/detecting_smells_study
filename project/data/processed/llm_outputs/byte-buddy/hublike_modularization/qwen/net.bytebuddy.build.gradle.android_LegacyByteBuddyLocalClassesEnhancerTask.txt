    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 3 distinct classes. The outgoing dependencies include core ByteBuddy classes such as ClassFileVersion, Plugin, EntryPoint, MethodNameTransformer, ClassFileLocator, BuildLogger, and AndroidDescriptor. The incoming dependencies come from multiple classes within the same package including ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin, ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.TransformationDispatcher, and ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.ForLegacyAndroid. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
