    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService.State' has only 5 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to many other abstractions. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
