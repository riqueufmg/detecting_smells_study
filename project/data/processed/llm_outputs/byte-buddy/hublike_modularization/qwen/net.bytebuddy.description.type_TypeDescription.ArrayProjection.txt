    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ArrayProjection' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
