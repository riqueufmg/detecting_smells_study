    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.UsingJump' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies) and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod'. The dependencies are focused and do not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit excessive coupling or serve as a central coordinator for numerous other classes."
