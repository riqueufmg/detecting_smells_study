    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AnnotationReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AnnotationReader' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include 'RecordComponentDescription', 'JavaDispatcher', 'AccessControllerPlugin', and 'AnnotationList', which themselves have numerous further dependencies. The incoming dependencies come from 'TypeDescription', which also has a large number of dependencies. This pattern of having multiple dependencies with high connectivity indicates hub-like modularization."
