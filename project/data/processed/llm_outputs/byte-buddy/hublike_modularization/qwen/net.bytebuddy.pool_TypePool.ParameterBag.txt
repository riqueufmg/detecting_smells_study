    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ParameterBag' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize' and is only depended upon by one class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool'. The number of dependencies is not large enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
