    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode.ImageCodeContextAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.GraalImageCode' and one incoming dependency from the same class. The total number of dependencies is minimal (2), which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
