    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfNonGenericType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.OfNonGenericType' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction ('TypeDescription'). The outgoing dependencies include core abstractions such as 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', 'AnnotationSource', and 'TypeList', indicating a central role in the type description hierarchy. The presence of both numerous outgoing and incoming dependencies confirms its hub-like role in the modularization structure."
