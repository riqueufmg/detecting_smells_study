    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.TypeVariableSubstitutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, TypeVariableSource, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While MethodDescription itself has many dependencies, the TypeVariableSubstitutor class only directly depends on these 3 abstractions, which is not a large number indicating hub-like modularization."
