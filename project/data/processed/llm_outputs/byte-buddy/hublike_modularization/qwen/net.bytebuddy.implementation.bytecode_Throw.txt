{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Throw",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Throw' has incoming dependencies from 5 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes. The total number of dependencies (incoming + outgoing = 7) is relatively high, indicating that this class acts as a hub by being involved in numerous interactions with other abstractions. Additionally, it is referenced by multiple classes in the 'net.bytebuddy.asm' package, which suggests central usage across different modules."
