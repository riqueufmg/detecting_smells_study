{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.FieldGetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes TypeDescription, StackManipulation, MethodAccessorFactory, FieldDescription, and Assigner. While some of these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies (e.g., TypeDescription has 45 dependencies), the Binder.FieldGetter class itself does not show hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or incoming dependencies."
