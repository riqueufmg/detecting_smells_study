    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FilterableList, AnnotationDescription, and TypeList. While AnnotationDescription and TypeList have multiple dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not directly depend on those additional classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
