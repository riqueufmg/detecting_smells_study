```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition.SuperClassIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
