    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (8) and incoming dependencies (1). The dependencies are focused on related type description and pool classes, which is expected for a resolution class in a type pool system. The number of dependencies is not excessive for its role, and it does not show signs of being a hub with numerous unrelated connections."
