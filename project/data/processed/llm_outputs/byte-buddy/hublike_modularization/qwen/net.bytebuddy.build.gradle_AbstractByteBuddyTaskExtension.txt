    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and no incoming dependencies. While the number of outgoing dependencies is moderate, the class acts as a central point coordinating interactions with multiple abstractions such as 'ClassFileVersion', 'Discovery', 'EntryPoint', 'Transformation', 'ObjectFactory', and 'Adjustment'. This central role in managing dependencies across different components indicates hub-like behavior."
