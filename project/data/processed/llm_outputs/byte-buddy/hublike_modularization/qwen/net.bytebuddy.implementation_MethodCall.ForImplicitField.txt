    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldLocator and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which is not a large number of dependencies. There is no evidence of hub-like modularization as the class does not show excessive dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
