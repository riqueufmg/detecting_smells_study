```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.RecordComponentTokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes (RecordComponentDescription and RecordComponentList) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
