{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedReturnType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin' and no incoming dependencies. The dependent class 'CachedReturnPlugin' has many outgoing dependencies, but this does not indicate that 'TypeDescription.ForLoadedReturnType' itself is hub-like. For a hub-like modularization smell, the class in question should have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
