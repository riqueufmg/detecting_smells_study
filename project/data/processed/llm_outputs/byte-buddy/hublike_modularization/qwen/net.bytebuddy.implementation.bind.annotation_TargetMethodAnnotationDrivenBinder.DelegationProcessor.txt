    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.DelegationProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include complex hierarchies such as TypeDescription with 64 dependencies, Implementation with 36 dependencies, Binder with 51 dependencies, and others with significant dependency counts. This wide range of dependencies indicates hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions both directly and indirectly through its dependencies' own extensive relationships."
