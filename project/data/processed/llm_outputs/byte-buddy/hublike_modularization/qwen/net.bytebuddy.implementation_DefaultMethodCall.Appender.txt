    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.DefaultMethodCall.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The lack of significant incoming or outgoing connections indicates it is not a hub-like module."
