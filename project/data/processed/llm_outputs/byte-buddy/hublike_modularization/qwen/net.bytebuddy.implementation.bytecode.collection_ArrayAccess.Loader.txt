{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayAccess.Loader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While Implementation has many dependencies itself, the ArrayAccess.Loader class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies nor does it serve as a central hub for other classes to depend on."
