{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Delegator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.Delegator' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypeDescription') which itself has a large number of dependencies (39). The class interacts with multiple abstractions across different packages such as 'RecordComponentDescription', 'JavaDispatcher', 'AccessControllerPlugin', and 'AnnotationList'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
