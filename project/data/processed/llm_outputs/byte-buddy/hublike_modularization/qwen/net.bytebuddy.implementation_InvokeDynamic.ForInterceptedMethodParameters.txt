    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForInterceptedMethodParameters' has a high number of incoming dependencies, as it is referenced by 30 different classes/interfaces within the 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' package and its sub-packages. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner', which itself has multiple outgoing dependencies. This creates a hub-like structure where this class acts as a central point connecting numerous other abstractions both directly and indirectly."
