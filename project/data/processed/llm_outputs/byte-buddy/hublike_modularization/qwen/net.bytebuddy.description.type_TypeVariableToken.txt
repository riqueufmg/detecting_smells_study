    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeVariableToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeVariableToken' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 14 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
