    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. The incoming dependencies are from SuperMethodCall. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
