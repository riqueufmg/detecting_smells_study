```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTaskConfiguration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (DirectoryProperty and ByteBuddyTask) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
