    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.IncompleteToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool, which itself has numerous dependencies. However, TypePool.IncompleteToken does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from other classes. The single incoming dependency is from a hub-like class (TypePool), but this does not make TypePool.IncompleteToken itself hub-like."
