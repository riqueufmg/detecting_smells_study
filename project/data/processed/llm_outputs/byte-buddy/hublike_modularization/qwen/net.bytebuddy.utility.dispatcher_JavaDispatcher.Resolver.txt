    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.Resolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency shows that JavaDispatcher depends on this class, but this does not indicate hub-like behavior as the class itself does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The metrics indicate limited coupling rather than hub-like modularization."
