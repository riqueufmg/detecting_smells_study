{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.NullConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'NullConstant' has outgoing dependencies to 'Implementation' which in turn has a large number of outgoing dependencies to various abstractions. Additionally, 'NullConstant' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes across different packages such as 'NexusAccessor', 'Advice', 'MemberSubstitution', and 'FixedValue', indicating that it is widely used. This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of abstractions confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
