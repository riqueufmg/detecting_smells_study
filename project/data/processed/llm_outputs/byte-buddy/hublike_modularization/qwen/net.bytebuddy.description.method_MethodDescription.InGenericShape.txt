    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ParameterDescription and TypeDescription, which themselves have many dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies further indicates it is not a hub-like module."
