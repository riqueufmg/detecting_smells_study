    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask and ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask, and the incoming dependency is from ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
