{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Simplex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Although 'MethodDescription' itself has many dependencies, the 'Binder.Simplex' class does not directly depend on those, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
