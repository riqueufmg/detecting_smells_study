{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyMethodDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyMethodDescription' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes: 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeList', 'ParameterList', 'ParameterDescription', and 'AnnotationValue'. Each of these classes in turn has a large number of their own dependencies, indicating that 'LazyMethodDescription' interacts with a wide range of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This creates a hub-like structure where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other parts of the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
