    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForExplicitField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While FieldDescription itself has multiple dependencies, the analyzed class MethodCall.ForExplicitField only directly depends on these two abstractions, which is not a large number indicating hub-like modularization."
