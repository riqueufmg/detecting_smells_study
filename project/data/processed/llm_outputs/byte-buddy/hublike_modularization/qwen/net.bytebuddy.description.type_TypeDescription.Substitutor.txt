{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Substitutor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.Substitutor' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions: TypeVariableSource, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TargetType, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, ElementMatcher, and TypeList. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'TypeDescription', which itself depends on a large number of abstractions (35). This pattern of having both numerous outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
