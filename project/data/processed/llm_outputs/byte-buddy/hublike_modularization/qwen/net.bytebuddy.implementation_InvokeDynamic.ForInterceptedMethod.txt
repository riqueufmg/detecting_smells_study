    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic', which itself depends on many classes including the analyzed class. However, the analyzed class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions directly."
