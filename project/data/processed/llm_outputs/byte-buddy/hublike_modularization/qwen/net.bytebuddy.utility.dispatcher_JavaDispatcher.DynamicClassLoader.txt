    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.DynamicClassLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaDispatcher.DynamicClassLoader' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies both incoming and outgoing. It directly depends on 6 other abstractions: 'ClassFileVersion', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeWriter', 'MethodComparator', and 'AsmVisitorWrapper'. Additionally, it is depended upon by 'JavaDispatcher', which itself has a large number of dependencies, indicating centralization of dependencies around this class. The wide range of dependencies suggests it acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system."
