    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows VirtualMachine class depends on this class along with 11 other VirtualMachine inner classes and implementations, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for this specific class as it has minimal dependencies itself."
