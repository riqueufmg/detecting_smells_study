    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodAccessorFactory' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 16 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
