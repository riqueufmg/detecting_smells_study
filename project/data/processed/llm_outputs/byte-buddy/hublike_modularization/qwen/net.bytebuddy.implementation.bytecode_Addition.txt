{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Addition",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Addition' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('Implementation' and 'StackSize') and incoming dependencies from 7 classes. The outgoing dependency to 'Implementation' involves 34 other abstractions, indicating a high number of outgoing dependencies. Additionally, multiple incoming dependencies from various classes in 'net.bytebuddy.asm' and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' packages show a large number of incoming dependencies. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies 'Addition' as Hub-like Modularization."
