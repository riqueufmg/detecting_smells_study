{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaWindowsNamedPipe",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows that VirtualMachine depends on this class along with other VirtualMachine inner classes and implementations, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for this specific class. Hub-like modularization requires the class itself to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
