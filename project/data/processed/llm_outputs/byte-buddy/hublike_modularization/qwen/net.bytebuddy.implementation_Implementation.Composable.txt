    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Composable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.Composable' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to high incoming and outgoing dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('Implementation', 'ByteCodeAppender', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin') and is also listed as a dependency in the incoming dependencies of 'Implementation', which itself has a large number of outgoing dependencies (29). The class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for hub-like modularization."
