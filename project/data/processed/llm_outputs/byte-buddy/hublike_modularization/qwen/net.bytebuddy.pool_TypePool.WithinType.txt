    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithinType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. Although MethodDescription itself has many dependencies, the TypePool.WithinType class in isolation only directly depends on these two classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
