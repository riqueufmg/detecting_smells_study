    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstrumentedType' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes, including 'TypeDescription' which itself has 60+ dependencies, 'Implementation' with 30+ dependencies, 'StackManipulation' with 5 dependencies, and 'Assigner' with 5 dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'MethodCall' which has 60+ dependencies. This results in the class being involved in a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
