    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.TypeManifestation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeManifestation' has only one outgoing dependency to 'ModifierContributor' and is listed in the dependencies of four other classes ('AgentBuilder', 'AgentBuilder.LambdaInstrumentationStrategy', 'AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory', 'ByteBuddy') and appears in the dependencies of 'ModifierReviewable' and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase'. This level of incoming and outgoing dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as it does not show a large number of dependencies relative to the system context provided."
