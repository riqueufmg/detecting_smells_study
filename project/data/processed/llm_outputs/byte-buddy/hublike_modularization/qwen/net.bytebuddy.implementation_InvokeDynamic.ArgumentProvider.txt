```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ArgumentProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ArgumentProvider' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic'), which itself depends on 30 other classes. This creates a hub-like dependency structure where ArgumentProvider is central to a large number of dependencies, both directly and indirectly through its incoming dependencies. The high number of outgoing dependencies and its role as a dependency for a class with extensive outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
