    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Illegal' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' and one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it interacting with a large number of other abstractions either in terms of incoming or outgoing dependencies."
