    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) and one incoming dependency (InvokeDynamic). The outgoing dependency TypeDescription has many internal dependencies, but these are not direct dependencies of ReturnTypeProvider. The number of direct dependencies (incoming + outgoing) is minimal, not indicating hub-like modularization."
