    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AnnotationValue, MethodDescription, and TypeDescription. While these classes themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not show a pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class appears to be narrowly focused on type description within the annotation value hierarchy."
