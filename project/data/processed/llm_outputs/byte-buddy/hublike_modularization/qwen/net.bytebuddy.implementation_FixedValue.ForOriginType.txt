    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForOriginType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner and TypeDescription, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies further indicates it is not a hub-like component."
