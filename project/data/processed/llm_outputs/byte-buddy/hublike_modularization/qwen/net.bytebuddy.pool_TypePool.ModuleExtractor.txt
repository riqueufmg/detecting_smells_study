    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ModuleExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ModuleDescription and OpenedClassReader, each of which have their own dependencies, but the ModuleExtractor itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions."
