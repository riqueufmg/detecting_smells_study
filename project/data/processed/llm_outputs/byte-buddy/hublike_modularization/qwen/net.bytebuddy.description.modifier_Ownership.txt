    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Ownership",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to ModifierContributor) and is listed as a dependency in 14 incoming dependencies. While it is used by multiple classes, the number of its own dependencies is minimal, and it does not exhibit a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies which would indicate hub-like modularization."
