    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForConstructingInvocation' has outgoing dependencies to 6 classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'TypeDescription' which itself has 64 dependencies, 'Implementation' with 34 dependencies, 'StackManipulation' with 5 dependencies, 'Duplication' with 5 dependencies, and 'Assigner' with 5 dependencies. The incoming dependencies come from 'MethodCall' which has 68 dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
