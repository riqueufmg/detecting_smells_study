    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While MethodDescription itself has many dependencies, the TypePool.ForMismatchedType class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a limited number of direct dependencies."
