{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.Absolute",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldLocator, FieldDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While FieldLocator and FieldDescription have their own dependencies, the FieldAccessor.Absolute class itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have many incoming dependencies, thus not exhibiting hub-like modularization."
