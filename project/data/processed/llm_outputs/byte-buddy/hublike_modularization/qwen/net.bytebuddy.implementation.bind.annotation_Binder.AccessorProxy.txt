    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.AccessorProxy' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different abstractions and incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction ('Binder'), which itself has a large number of dependencies (29). This indicates that 'Binder.AccessorProxy' acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system, both in terms of outgoing and incoming relationships, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
