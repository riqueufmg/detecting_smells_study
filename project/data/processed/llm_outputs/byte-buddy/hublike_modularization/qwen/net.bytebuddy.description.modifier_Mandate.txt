    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Mandate' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor'. It is listed as a dependency in two incoming dependencies from classes 'ModifierReviewable' and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase', but this does not indicate a large number of dependencies in isolation. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
