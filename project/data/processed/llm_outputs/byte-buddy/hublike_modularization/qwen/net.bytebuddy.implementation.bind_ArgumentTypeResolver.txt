    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ArgumentTypeResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ArgumentTypeResolver' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include 'MethodDelegationBinder', 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'ParameterIndexToken', and 'ParameterList'. The incoming dependencies come from 'BindingMechanic', 'MethodDelegationBinder', and 'MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver'. This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
