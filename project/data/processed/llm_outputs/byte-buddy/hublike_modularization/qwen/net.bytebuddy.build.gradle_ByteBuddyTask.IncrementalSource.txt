```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTask.IncrementalSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin' and no incoming dependencies. The dependent class 'Plugin' itself has many dependencies, but this does not indicate that 'ByteBuddyTask.IncrementalSource' is hub-like. A hub-like modularization would require the analyzed class to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly, which is not the case here."
