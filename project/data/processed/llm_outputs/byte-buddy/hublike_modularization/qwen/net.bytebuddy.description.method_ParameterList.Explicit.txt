    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ParameterList, MethodDescription, and ParameterDescription, which are closely related abstractions within the same package. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not depend on a large number of unrelated abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other classes."
