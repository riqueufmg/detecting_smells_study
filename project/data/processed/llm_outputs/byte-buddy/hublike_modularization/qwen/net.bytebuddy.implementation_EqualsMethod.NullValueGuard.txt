    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.NullValueGuard' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4 direct dependencies) and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class 'EqualsMethod'. It does not exhibit a large number of dependencies with other abstractions, which is required for Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are focused and contextually related to its functionality within the equals method implementation."
