    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource.AbstractBase' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ModifierReviewable', 'TypeList', and 'TypeDescription'. While these dependent classes themselves have many dependencies, the 'TypeVariableSource.AbstractBase' class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
