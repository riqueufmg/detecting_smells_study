    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Dispatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.Dispatcher' has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'JavaDispatcher' which itself has 16 dependencies, 'TypeList' with 11 dependencies, and 'TypeDescription' with 64 dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, especially with 'TypeDescription' being both a dependency and a dependent, indicates hub-like behavior where this class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions."
