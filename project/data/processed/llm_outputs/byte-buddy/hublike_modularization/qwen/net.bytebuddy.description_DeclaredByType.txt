{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.DeclaredByType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.DeclaredByType' has incoming dependencies from 5 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class which itself has multiple outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies include 'RecordComponentDescription', 'ByteCodeElement', 'ByteCodeElement.Member', 'FieldDescription', and 'MethodDescription'. The outgoing dependency is to 'TypeDefinition', which in turn has dependencies to 11 other classes. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
