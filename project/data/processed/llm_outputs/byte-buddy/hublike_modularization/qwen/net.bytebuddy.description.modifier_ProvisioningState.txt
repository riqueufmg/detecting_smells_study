    "justification": "The class 'ProvisioningState' has only one outgoing dependency to 'ModifierContributor' and is listed among multiple classes in the incoming dependencies from 'ModifierReviewable' and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase'. While it participates in a modular structure with several related classes, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies itself nor does it act as a central hub connecting many other abstractions."
