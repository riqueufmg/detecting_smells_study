    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.LoadedTypeInitializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'LoadedTypeInitializer' has incoming dependencies from 24 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, and the outgoing dependencies show that it interacts with multiple other abstractions. This pattern of having both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
