    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 30 other classes/interfaces and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (TypeProxy), indicating it acts as a hub with numerous connections. Specifically, it depends on many classes in the Implementation package and related bytecode manipulation classes, while also being depended upon by TypeProxy and potentially others, creating a central point of coupling."
