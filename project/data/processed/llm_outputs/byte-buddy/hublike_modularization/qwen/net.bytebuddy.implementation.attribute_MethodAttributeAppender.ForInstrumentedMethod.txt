    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'AnnotationAppender' and 'TypeDescription', which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by many others."
