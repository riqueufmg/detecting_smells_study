    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes, which in turn have numerous further dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from MethodCallProxy which itself depends on multiple classes including Implementation, DynamicType, ByteBuddy, and others. The class acts as a central point connecting different parts of the system through its dependencies and is depended upon by core classes, indicating hub-like behavior."
