    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationSource' has incoming dependencies from 12 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes, creating a total of 14 dependencies. This high number of dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, indicates that 'AnnotationSource' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
