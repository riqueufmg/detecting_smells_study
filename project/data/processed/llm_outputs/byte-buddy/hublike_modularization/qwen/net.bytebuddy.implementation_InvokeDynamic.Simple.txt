    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Simple' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies indicating that this class is not a hub for other classes in the system. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
