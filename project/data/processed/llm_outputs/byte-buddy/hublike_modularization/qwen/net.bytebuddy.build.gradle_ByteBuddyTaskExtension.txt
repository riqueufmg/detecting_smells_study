    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTaskExtension",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IncrementalResolver and ByteBuddyTask) and no incoming dependencies. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
