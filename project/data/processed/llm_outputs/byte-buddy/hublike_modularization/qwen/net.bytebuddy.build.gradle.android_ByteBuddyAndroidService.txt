    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidService",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ByteBuddyAndroidService' has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include core ByteBuddy classes such as 'ByteBuddy', 'TypeDescription', 'Plugin', 'DynamicType', 'ClassFileVersion', 'TypePool', 'ClassFileLocator', as well as nested classes like 'ByteBuddyAndroidService.State' and 'ByteBuddyInstrumentationParameters'. The incoming dependencies come from classes within the same package ('ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin', 'ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.VariantAction', 'ByteBuddyAsmClassVisitorFactory'). This pattern of having both numerous outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where this class acts as a central coordinator interacting with many other abstractions in the system."
