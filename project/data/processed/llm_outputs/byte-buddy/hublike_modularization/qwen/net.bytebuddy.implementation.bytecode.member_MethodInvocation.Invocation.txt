    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.Invocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions: ClassFileVersion, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, Implementation, StackManipulation, TypeList, and JavaConstant. This indicates a high number of outgoing dependencies, contributing to hub-like modularization."
