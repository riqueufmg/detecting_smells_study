{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.TerminationHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (MethodCall) which itself has a large number of dependencies. The class acts as a central point in the module, managing termination behavior for method calls and interacting with core abstractions like StackManipulation, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, and Assigner. This central role with multiple dependencies in both directions indicates hub-like modularization."
