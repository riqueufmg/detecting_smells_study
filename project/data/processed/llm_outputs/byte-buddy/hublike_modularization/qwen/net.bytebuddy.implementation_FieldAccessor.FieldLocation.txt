{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.FieldLocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to FieldLocator and FieldDescription which are closely related to field access functionality, and the single incoming dependency is from its enclosing class FieldAccessor. This does not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
