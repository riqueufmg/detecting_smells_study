    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, ParameterDescription, and TypeDescription. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization based on its direct dependency profile."
