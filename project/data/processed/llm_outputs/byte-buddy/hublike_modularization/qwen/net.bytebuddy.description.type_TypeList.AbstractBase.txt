    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.AbstractBase' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypeList', 'FilterableList', 'ByteCodeElement', and 'TypeDescription'. While 'TypeDescription' has many dependencies, this does not directly indicate that 'TypeList.AbstractBase' itself has hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit a high number of dependencies in either direction, which is required for hub-like modularization."
