    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForRecordComponent' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 11 other abstractions in 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription' and incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool' which depends on 64 abstractions, including the analyzed class itself. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
