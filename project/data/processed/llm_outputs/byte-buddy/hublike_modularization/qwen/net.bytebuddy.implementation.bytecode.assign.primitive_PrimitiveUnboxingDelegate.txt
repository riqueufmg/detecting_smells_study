    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting multiple abstractions. Specifically, it depends on core framework classes such as 'TypeDescription', 'Implementation', 'Assigner', and 'StackSize', while also being depended upon by 'PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner' and its own inner classes, showing a central role in the module's structure."
