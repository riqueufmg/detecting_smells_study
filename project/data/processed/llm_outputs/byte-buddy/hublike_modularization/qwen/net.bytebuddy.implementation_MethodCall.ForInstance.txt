    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstance",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodCall.ForInstance' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes, including 'TypeDescription', 'Implementation', 'StackManipulation', 'FieldDescription', and 'Assigner', each of which in turn has a large number of their own dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'MethodCall' class, which itself depends on a vast array of 60+ elements. This pattern of having both a large number of outgoing and incoming dependencies with many other abstractions indicates a hub-like structure where 'MethodCall.ForInstance' acts as a central point connecting numerous other components."
