{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic' has outgoing dependencies to 33 other classes and 1 incoming dependency. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the presence of incoming dependencies suggests that other classes rely on it, further supporting its role as a hub in the modular structure."
