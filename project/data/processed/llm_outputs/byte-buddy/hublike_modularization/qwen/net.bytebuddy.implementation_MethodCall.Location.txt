    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Location' has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on three classes: 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator', 'net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription', and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it is only depended on by one class, 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall', which has numerous dependencies itself but does not indicate that 'MethodCall.Location' is a hub. The number of incoming and outgoing dependencies for 'MethodCall.Location' is not extensive enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
