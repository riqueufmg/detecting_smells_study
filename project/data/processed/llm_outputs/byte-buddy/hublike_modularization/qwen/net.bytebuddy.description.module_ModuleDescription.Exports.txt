    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ModuleDescription.Exports' has only two outgoing dependencies (JavaDispatcher and ModifierReviewable) and one incoming dependency (ModuleDescription). While the dependencies themselves have numerous further dependencies, the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction, which is the key indicator for Hub-like Modularization."
