    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (RandomString and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
