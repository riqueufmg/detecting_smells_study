    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Illegal' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which itself has many dependencies. However, the class in question does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing."
