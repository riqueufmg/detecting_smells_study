    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ForPrimitiveType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to Implementation) and one incoming dependency (from ArrayFactory). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
