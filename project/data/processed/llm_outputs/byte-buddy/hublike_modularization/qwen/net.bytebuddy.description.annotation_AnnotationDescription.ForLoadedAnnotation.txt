{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationDescription.ForLoadedAnnotation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct classes: EnumerationDescription, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, AccessControllerPlugin, AnnotationDescription, and AnnotationValue. Additionally, it is part of a package (net.bytebuddy.description.annotation) that contains other highly connected classes such as AnnotationDescription and AnnotationValue, which themselves have numerous dependencies. This indicates that the class participates in a dense dependency network, both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
