    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.HandleType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from MethodInvocation class. The incoming dependency shows MethodInvocation depends on 11 other classes, but this represents a single source of incoming dependency, not multiple different abstractions depending on HandleType. HandleType itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
