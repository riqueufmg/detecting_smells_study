    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'InstanceCheck' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies: StackManipulation, Implementation, TypeDescription) and no incoming dependencies. While some of its outgoing dependencies like 'Implementation' and 'TypeDescription' themselves have many dependencies, the 'InstanceCheck' class in isolation does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies in either direction, which is required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
