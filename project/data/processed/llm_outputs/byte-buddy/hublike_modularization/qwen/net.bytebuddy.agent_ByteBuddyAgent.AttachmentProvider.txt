{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider' has only one outgoing dependency to 'VirtualMachine' and one incoming dependency from 'ByteBuddyAgent'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
