    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitType' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic'. The dependencies are focused on specific functional areas such as method descriptions, type descriptions, field locators, and assigners, which aligns with its role in handling invoke dynamic operations with implicit types. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
