{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.OfConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, TypeDescription, and AnnotationList, which are relatively few and focused. While these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies, which would be indicative of hub-like modularization."
