    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Invokedynamic' has only outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. There are no incoming dependencies, further reducing its connectivity. Hub-like modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not present in this case."
