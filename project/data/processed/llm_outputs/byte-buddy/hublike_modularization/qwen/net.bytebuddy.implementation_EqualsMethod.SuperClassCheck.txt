    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation and MethodVariableAccess, and the incoming dependency is from EqualsMethod. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
