{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForSelfOrStaticInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include classes from multiple packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription' which itself has 64 dependencies, 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription' with 21 dependencies, 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' with 26 dependencies, and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner' with 5 dependencies. This indicates that the class is connected to abstractions with numerous dependencies, suggesting hub-like behavior."
