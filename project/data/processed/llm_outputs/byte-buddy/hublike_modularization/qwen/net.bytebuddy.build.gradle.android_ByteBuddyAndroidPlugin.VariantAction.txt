{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin.VariantAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to ByteBuddyAndroidService and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency itself has multiple dependencies, but the VariantAction class in isolation only maintains a single dependency relationship, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
