    "justification": "The class 'DeclaringTypeResolver' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (2). The outgoing dependencies are to 'MethodDescription', 'MethodDelegationBinder', and 'TypeDescription'. The incoming dependencies are from 'MethodDelegationBinder' and 'MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver'. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not excessively connected to a large number of other abstractions."
