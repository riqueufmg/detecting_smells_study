    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Although JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class 'TypeDescription.ForLoadedField' does not directly depend on those classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
