    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to core infrastructure classes such as TypeDefinition, Implementation, StackManipulation, and StackSize. The incoming dependency is from PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner. There is no evidence of excessive or hub-like dependency relationships that would indicate the Hub-like Modularization smell."
