    "justification": "The class 'MethodDelegationBinder.Default' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to multiple classes including 'StackManipulation' and 'Assigner', which themselves have several further dependencies. Additionally, it has significant incoming dependencies from 'MethodDelegationBinder', which depends on a large number of other abstractions. This central role with numerous incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like behavior."
