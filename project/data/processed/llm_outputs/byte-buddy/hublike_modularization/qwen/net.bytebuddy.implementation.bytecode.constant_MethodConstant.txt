```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodConstant' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include classes from different packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation', and others. The incoming dependencies come from classes like 'InvocationHandlerAdapter' and 'Binder' in different packages. This pattern of having both a significant number of outgoing and incoming dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
