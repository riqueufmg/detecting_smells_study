    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.ForClassFileApi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to JavaDispatcher (which has many dependencies but that does not count towards this class's direct dependencies) and AccessControllerPlugin. The incoming dependency is from AsmClassWriter. This is not a large number of direct dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
