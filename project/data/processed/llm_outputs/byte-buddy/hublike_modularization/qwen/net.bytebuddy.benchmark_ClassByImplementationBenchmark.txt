    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByImplementationBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassByImplementationBenchmark' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class ('StubInvocationBenchmark'). The outgoing dependencies include complex abstractions such as 'TypeDescription', 'ElementMatchers', 'TypePool', and 'ClassLoadingStrategy', each of which itself has numerous further dependencies. This creates a hub-like structure where 'ClassByImplementationBenchmark' acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions, both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
