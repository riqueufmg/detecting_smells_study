    "justification": "The Transformation class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to PluginArgument) and 1 incoming dependency (from ByteBuddyAndroidTaskExtension). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like structure where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
