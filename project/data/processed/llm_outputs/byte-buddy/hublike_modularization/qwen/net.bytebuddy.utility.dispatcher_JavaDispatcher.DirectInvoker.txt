    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.DirectInvoker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, and only has one dependency to net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin which is likely an annotation. A hub-like modularization smell requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, but this class shows minimal dependency relationships."
