    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from AndroidClassLoadingStrategy, which is its enclosing class. The incoming dependencies list shows only one source class with 7 dependencies, but this represents a single dependency relationship from one class, not multiple incoming dependencies from different classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous bidirectional dependencies."
