    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ContravariantBinding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on TypeList which has many dependencies itself, the ContravariantBinding class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
