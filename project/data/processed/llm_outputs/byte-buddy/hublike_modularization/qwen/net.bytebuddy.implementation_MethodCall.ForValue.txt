    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForValue' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes, including 'TypeDescription', 'Implementation', 'StackManipulation', 'FieldDescription', and 'Assigner'. Additionally, it is depended upon by the 'MethodCall' class, which itself has a large number of dependencies (29), indicating that 'ForValue' is central in the dependency structure. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of the Hub-like Modularization smell."
