    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant.OfMethodTypeDesc' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has 1 outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher', which itself has 16 outgoing dependencies to various classes. Additionally, it has 1 incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaConstant', which depends on 26 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
