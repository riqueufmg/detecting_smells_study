    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Simple' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall', which itself depends on a large number of abstractions (35 listed), indicating that 'MethodCall.Simple' is a central point of interaction. The combination of multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies with numerous other abstractions confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
