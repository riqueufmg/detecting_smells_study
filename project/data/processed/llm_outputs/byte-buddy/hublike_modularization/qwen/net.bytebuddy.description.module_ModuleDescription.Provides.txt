    "justification": "The class 'ModuleDescription.Provides' has only one outgoing dependency to 'JavaDispatcher' and one incoming dependency from 'ModuleDescription'. The number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
