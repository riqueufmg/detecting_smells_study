```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription and JavaConstant, each of which has many dependencies themselves, but the class Implementation.Illegal itself does not directly depend on those numerous classes. The incoming dependency is from Implementation class which depends on many classes including Implementation.Illegal. However, the number of direct dependencies for Implementation.Illegal is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where the class itself would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
