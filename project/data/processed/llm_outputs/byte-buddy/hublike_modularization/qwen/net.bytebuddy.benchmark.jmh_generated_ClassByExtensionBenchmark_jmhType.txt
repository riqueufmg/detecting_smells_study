    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and 16 incoming dependencies from test classes within the same package. While it has multiple incoming dependencies, these are all from closely related benchmark test classes, not indicating hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of different abstractions nor is it a central hub connecting diverse modules."
