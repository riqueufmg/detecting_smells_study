    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.CacheValueField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldDescription, TypeDescription, and AnnotationList. While these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The metric for hub-like modularization focuses on the direct dependencies of the class being analyzed, not the dependencies of its dependencies."
