    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.SuperMethodCall' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include both inner classes (Appender, TerminationHandler, WithoutReturn) and external classes such as 'InstrumentedType', 'Implementation', 'StackManipulation', 'ByteCodeAppender'. The incoming dependencies come from classes like 'ConstructorStrategy', 'Advice', and 'ByteBuddy', indicating that this class is widely used and interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, which satisfies the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
