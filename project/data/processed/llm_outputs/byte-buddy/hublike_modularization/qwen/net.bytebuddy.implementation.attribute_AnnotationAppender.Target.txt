    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency is from AnnotationAppender which has multiple dependencies, but the Target class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics as it has limited connections to other classes."
