    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.TargetHandler' has outgoing dependencies to 12 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
