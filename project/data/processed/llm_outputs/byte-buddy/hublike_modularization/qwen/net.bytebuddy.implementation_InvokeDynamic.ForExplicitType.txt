{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForExplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. Although 'TypeDescription' itself has many dependencies, the 'InvokeDynamic.ForExplicitType' class does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies (either incoming or outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions."
