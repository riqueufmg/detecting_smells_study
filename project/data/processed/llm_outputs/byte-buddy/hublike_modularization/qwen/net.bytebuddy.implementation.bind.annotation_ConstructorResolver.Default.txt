{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to two distinct classes (MethodDescription and TypeDescription) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
