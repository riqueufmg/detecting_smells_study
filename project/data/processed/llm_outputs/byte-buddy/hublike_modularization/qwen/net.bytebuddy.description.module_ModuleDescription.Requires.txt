{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.Requires",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ModuleDescription.Requires' has only two outgoing dependencies (JavaDispatcher and ModifierReviewable) and one incoming dependency (ModuleDescription). While these dependencies themselves have multiple further dependencies, the direct dependency count for 'ModuleDescription.Requires' is low. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly; this condition is not met here."
