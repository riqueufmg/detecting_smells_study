    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedExecutableParameterType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Although JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class only directly depends on these two classes/packages, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
