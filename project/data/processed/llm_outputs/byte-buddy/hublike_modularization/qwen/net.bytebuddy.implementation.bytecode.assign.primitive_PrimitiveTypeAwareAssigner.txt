    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions and no incoming dependencies. While the number of outgoing dependencies is moderate, the class acts as a central assigner dealing with primitive types and their conversions, interacting with multiple delegates (e.g., PrimitiveWideningDelegate, PrimitiveBoxingDelegate, PrimitiveUnboxingDelegate) and core abstractions like TypeDescription and StackManipulation. This central role in managing primitive type assignments indicates hub-like behavior within its modularization context."
