    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.Token' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and only one incoming dependency from 'RecordComponentDescription'. The dependencies are not extensive enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
