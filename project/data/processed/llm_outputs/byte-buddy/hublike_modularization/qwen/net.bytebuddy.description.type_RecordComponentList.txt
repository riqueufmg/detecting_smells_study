    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RecordComponentList' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 20 other classes. The high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, interacting with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of usage (outgoing) and being used (incoming), which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
