    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyFieldDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FieldDescription and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency to FieldDescription has multiple dependencies itself, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class TypePool.LazyFieldDescription, as it only connects to one other abstraction directly."
