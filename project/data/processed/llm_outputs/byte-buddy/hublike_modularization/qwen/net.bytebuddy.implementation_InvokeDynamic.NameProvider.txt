{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.NameProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency shows that InvokeDynamic depends on many classes, but this does not indicate that NameProvider itself has many direct dependencies. NameProvider appears as a leaf node in the dependency structure with minimal connections."
