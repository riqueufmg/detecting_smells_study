{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationAppender' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 23 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting numerous other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
