{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as MethodDelegationBinder, ParameterLengthResolver, ArgumentTypeResolver, Resolver, DeclaringTypeResolver, and MethodNameEqualityResolver. The incoming dependencies originate from MethodDelegationBinder, which itself has a large number of dependencies. This pattern of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
