    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Delegate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.Delegate' has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct classes across multiple packages. Additionally, some of its outgoing dependencies (e.g., 'MethodDelegationBinder', 'Implementation', 'JavaConstant') have extensive outgoing dependencies themselves, indicating a high level of interconnectedness. This pattern of a class interacting directly with numerous other abstractions, both in breadth and depth, constitutes Hub-like Modularization."
