    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Malformed",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Malformed' has only 5 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive coupling with a large number of other abstractions. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
