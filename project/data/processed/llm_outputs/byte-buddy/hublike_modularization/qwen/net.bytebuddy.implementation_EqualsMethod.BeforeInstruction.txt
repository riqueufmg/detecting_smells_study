    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.BeforeInstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which is not a large number of dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
