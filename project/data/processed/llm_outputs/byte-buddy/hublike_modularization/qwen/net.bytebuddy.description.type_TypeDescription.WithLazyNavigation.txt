    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WithLazyNavigation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.WithLazyNavigation' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes: 'TypeDefinition', 'TypeDescription', 'TypeList', and 'CachedReturnPlugin'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'TypeDescription', which itself has a large number of outgoing dependencies. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions, both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, indicating hub-like modularization."
