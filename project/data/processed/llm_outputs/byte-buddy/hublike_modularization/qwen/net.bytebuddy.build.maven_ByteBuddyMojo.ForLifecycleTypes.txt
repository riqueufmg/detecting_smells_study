    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForLifecycleTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have many dependencies, but the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing). Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly, which is not the case here."
