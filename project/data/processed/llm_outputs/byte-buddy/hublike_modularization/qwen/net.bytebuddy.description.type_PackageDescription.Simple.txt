    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.PackageDescription.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to AnnotationList and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency to AnnotationList shows moderate coupling but does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
