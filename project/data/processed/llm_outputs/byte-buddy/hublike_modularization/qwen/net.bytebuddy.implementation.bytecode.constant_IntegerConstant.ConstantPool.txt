    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.IntegerConstant.ConstantPool",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While the Implementation class has many dependencies (26), this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself, as the metric focuses on the dependencies of the class in question, not its dependencies' dependencies. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
