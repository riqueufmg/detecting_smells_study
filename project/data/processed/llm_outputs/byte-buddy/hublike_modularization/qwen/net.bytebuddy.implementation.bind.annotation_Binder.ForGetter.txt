{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForGetter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, DynamicType, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While MethodDescription and DynamicType each have many dependencies themselves, the class Binder.ForGetter does not directly depend on those numerous classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
