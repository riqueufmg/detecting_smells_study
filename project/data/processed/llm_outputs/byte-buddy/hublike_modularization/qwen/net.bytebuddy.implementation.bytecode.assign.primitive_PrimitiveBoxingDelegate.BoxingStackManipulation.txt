    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.primitive.PrimitiveBoxingDelegate.BoxingStackManipulation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation and Implementation, which are core abstractions. While Implementation has many dependencies itself, this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class, as it only directly depends on two abstractions."
