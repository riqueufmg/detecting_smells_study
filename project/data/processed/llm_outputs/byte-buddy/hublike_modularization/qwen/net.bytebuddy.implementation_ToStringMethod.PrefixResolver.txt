{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod.PrefixResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency from a single class (ToStringMethod). The incoming dependency list shows that ToStringMethod depends on many classes, but this does not indicate that PrefixResolver itself has dependencies with a large number of abstractions. PrefixResolver appears to be a simple interface/class with minimal coupling."
