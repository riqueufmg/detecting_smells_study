    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodBinding' has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct classes: 'StackManipulation', 'MethodDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'Implementation'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'MethodDelegationBinder', which itself depends on 16 other classes. The combination of multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates that 'MethodBinding' acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
