    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.OfMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, TypeDescription, and AnnotationList, which are fundamental types in the domain. Although these dependencies themselves have many further dependencies, the OfMethod class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it serve as a hub with many incoming dependencies."
