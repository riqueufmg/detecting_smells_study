    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_jmhType and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (only 1 outgoing, 0 incoming) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
