    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForSuperMethodInvocation' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Implementation', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'TypeDescription'. The only incoming dependency is from 'MethodCall'. The number of dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a large number of interactions with other abstractions."
