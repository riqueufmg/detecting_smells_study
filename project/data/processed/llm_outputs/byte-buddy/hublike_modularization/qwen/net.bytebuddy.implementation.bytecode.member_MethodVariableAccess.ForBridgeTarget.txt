    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.ForBridgeTarget",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While MethodDescription itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class ForBridgeTarget only directly depends on these two abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
