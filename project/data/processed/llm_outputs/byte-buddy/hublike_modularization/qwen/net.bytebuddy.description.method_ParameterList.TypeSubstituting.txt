    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ParameterList.TypeSubstituting' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes: 'MethodDescription', 'ParameterDescription', and 'TypeDescription'. While these dependencies themselves have numerous outgoing dependencies, the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing). There are no incoming dependencies to this class, and only 3 outgoing dependencies, which does not qualify as hub-like modularization based on the provided data."
