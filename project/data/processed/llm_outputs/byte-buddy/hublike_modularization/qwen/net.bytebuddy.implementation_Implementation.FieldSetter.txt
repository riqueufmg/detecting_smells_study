    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.FieldSetter' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes, which is not excessively high. There are no incoming dependencies, indicating it is not a central hub. The dependencies are focused within the 'description' package hierarchy, suggesting a cohesive design rather than hub-like modularization."
