    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.ForJnaPosixSocket",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows VirtualMachine depends on multiple classes including this one, but this specific class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has minimal connections (0 outgoing, 1 incoming source). Hub-like modularization requires both high incoming and outgoing dependencies."
