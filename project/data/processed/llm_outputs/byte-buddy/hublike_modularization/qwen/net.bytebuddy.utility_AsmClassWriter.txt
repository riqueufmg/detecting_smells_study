    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AsmClassWriter' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and incoming dependencies from 17 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'AsmClassWriter' acts as a hub within the system, connecting to numerous other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
