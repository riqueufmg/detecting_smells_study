    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodStrictness' has only one outgoing dependency to 'ModifierContributor' and is listed among the dependencies of two incoming classes ('ModifierReviewable' and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase'), but the total number of unique dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is limited. It does not exhibit a high number of dependencies relative to the context size, thus not qualifying as Hub-like Modularization."
