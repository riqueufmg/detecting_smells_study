    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, MethodDelegationBinder, and Assigner, which are all directly related to its functionality of method delegation. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not show hub-like behavior with numerous direct connections."
