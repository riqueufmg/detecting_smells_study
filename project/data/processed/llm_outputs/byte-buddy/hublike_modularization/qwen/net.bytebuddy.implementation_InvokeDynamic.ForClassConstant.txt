{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForClassConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class ForClassConstant does not directly depend on those numerous classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions either incoming or outgoing."
