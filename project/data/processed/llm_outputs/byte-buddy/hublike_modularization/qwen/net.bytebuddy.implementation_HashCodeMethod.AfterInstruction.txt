{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.AfterInstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription has many dependencies itself, the analyzed class only directly depends on these three abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
