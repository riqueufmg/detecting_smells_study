{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.PosixLibrary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows that VirtualMachine depends on multiple classes including this one, but this class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class appears to be a simple library class with minimal coupling."
