    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ToStringMethod class. The incoming dependencies list shows 14 dependencies but these are dependencies of the ToStringMethod class, not dependencies pointing to this ValueConsumer class. The class itself has no dependencies indicating it is not a hub-like abstraction with many connections."
