    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfGenericArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.OfGenericArray' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypeDescription'). The number of dependencies (both outgoing and incoming) indicates a high level of coupling, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Specifically, it interacts with multiple core abstractions such as 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', 'AnnotationSource', and others across different packages, making it a central point of interaction in the system."
