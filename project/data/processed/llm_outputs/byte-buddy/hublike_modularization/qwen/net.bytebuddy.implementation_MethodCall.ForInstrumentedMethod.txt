    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForInstrumentedMethod' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has a high number of outgoing dependencies through its dependency on 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation', which itself depends on 35 other abstractions. Additionally, it has significant incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall', which depends on 45 different abstractions including numerous inner classes and related types. This creates a central hub with many bidirectional dependencies connecting it to a large number of other abstractions in the system."
