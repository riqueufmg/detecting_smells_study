    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (MethodDescription, Implementation, StackManipulation, MethodAccessorFactory) and these dependencies themselves have numerous outgoing dependencies, indicating a high number of transitive dependencies. The class acts as a hub connecting to multiple abstractions both directly and indirectly through its dependencies."
