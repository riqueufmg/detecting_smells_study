    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationValue.ForIncompatibleType' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'AnnotationValue', 'MethodDescription', and 'TypeDescription', and the incoming dependency is from 'AnnotationValue'. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a large number of dependencies with other abstractions."
