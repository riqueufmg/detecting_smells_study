    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes, including 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', and 'JavaConstant', each of which themselves have numerous further dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'Implementation', which also lists a large number of dependencies. The high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates that this class acts as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
