    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AsmClassReader.ForClassFileApi' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (2 unique classes: JavaDispatcher and AccessControllerPlugin) and only one incoming dependency from 'AsmClassReader'. The total number of dependencies is relatively low, which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
