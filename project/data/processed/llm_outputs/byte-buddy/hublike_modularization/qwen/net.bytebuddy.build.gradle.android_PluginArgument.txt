    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.PluginArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Transformation class. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
