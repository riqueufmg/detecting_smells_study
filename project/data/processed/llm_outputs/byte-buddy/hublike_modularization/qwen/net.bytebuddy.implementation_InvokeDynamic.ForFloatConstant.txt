{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForFloatConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the ForFloatConstant class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The total number of direct dependencies is low, which does not indicate hub-like modularization."
