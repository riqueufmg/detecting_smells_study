    "class": "org.gradle.work.ChangeType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 incoming dependencies from 2 different packages (net.bytebuddy.build.gradle and org.gradle.work) and no outgoing dependencies. This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization smell, as it does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
