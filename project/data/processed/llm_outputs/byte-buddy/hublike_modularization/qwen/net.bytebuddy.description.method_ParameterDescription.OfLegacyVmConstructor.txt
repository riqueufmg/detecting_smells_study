    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, TypeDescription, and AnnotationList, which are relatively few and focused. None of these dependencies show signs of being hubs themselves based on their listed dependencies. There is no evidence of this class acting as a hub with numerous incoming or outgoing connections to many other abstractions."
