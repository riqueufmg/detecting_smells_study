    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter', which itself depends on many classes. However, the class in question does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions."
