    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, indicating it does not interact with a large number of other abstractions. It only has a dependency on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin which appears to be a plugin annotation rather than a functional dependency."
