    "justification": "The class 'JavaConstantValue' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and only one incoming dependency from 'Invokedynamic'. The dependencies are focused on related abstractions within the bytecode implementation hierarchy and do not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class acts as a central coordinator with excessive dependencies."
