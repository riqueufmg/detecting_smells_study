{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AnnotationAppender and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While AnnotationAppender itself has many dependencies (8), the RecordComponentAttributeAppender.Explicit class itself does not directly depend on those classes, only on AnnotationAppender. The low number of direct dependencies (2 outgoing, 0 incoming) does not indicate hub-like modularization."
