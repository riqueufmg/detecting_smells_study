    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.ForField' has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
