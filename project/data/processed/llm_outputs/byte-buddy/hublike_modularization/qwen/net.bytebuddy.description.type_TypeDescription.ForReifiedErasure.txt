    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForReifiedErasure",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.ForReifiedErasure' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 0 classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'MethodList', 'FieldList', 'FieldDescription', 'TypeList', and 'AnnotationList'. This indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
