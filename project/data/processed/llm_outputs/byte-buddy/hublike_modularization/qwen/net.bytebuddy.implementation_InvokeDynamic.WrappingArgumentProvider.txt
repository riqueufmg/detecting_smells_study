    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WrappingArgumentProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation and Assigner, which themselves have further dependencies, but the WrappingArgumentProvider class itself does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. The dependency count is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
