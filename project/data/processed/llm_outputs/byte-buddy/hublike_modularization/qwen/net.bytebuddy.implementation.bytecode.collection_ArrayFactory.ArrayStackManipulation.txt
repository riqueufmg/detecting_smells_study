    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ArrayStackManipulation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes Implementation, StackSize, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While the Implementation class itself has many dependencies, the ArrayStackManipulation class only directly depends on these 3 abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
