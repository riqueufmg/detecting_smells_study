    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.StaticFieldByteCodeAppender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies (39), the StaticFieldByteCodeAppender class only directly depends on TypeDescription as a single abstraction. The total number of direct dependencies (3) is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
