{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.FieldAttributeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldAttributeAppender' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'AnnotationValueFilter', 'FieldDescription', 'AnnotationAppender', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 20 other abstractions, including multiple classes from 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' and 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other parts of the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
