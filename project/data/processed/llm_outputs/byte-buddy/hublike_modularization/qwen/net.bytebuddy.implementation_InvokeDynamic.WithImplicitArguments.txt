    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitArguments' has only two outgoing dependencies (MethodDescription and Assigner) and one incoming dependency (InvokeDynamic). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
