{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.Default' has outgoing dependencies to 19 other abstractions. Additionally, it is part of the 'Implementation' class which itself has outgoing dependencies to 30 other abstractions. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class is interacting with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
