{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to classes in related packages (net.bytebuddy, net.bytebuddy.build, net.bytebuddy.utility), and the incoming dependency is from one class (AsmClassReader) within the same package. This does not indicate a hub-like structure where the class acts as a central point with numerous dependencies."
