    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Resolved' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes, with 'TypeDescription' having 65 dependencies and 'StackManipulation' having 5 dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'InvokeDynamic' which depends on 31 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
