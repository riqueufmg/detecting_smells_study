    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.Explicit' has only outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes ('Implementation', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'TypeDescription') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
