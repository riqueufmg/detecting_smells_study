    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Duplication.WithFlip' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and it does not exhibit a hub-like pattern where it connects to a large number of other abstractions."
