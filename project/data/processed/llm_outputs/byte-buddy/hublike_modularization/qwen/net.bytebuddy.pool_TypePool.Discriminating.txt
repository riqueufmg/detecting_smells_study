{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Discriminating",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to ElementMatcher and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency chain shows ElementMatcher depends on 2 other classes, but this represents only 1 direct dependency from the analyzed class. The total dependency count (1 outgoing + 0 incoming = 1) is far below the threshold for hub-like modularization, which typically involves dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
