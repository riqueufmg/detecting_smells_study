    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency from ObjectFactory and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependency involves only 2 classes (ForLegacyGradle and Dispatcher itself), which is not a large number of dependencies indicative of hub-like modularization."
