    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeAnnotations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (TypeList) and 0 incoming dependencies. The dependency metrics show low connectivity with only 1 outgoing edge and no incoming edges, which does not indicate hub-like behavior where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
