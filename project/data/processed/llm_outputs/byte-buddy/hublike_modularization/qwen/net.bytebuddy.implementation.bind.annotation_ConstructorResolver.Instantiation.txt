{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.Instantiation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes, and the aggregated dependencies of these classes result in a large number of transitive dependencies (TypeDescription has 50+, Implementation has 30+, MethodDescription has 20+, TypeProxy has 20+, AnnotationDescription has 10+). This creates a hub-like structure where this class connects to a disproportionately large number of other abstractions through direct and indirect dependencies."
