{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.TypeLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. Although TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the ConstructorResolver.TypeLocator class does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction, thus does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
