{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForWildcardUpperBoundType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While the JavaDispatcher class itself has many dependencies (16), the TypeDescription.ForWildcardUpperBoundType class only directly depends on these two classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
