{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayFactory.ForReferenceType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While the Implementation class has many dependencies, the ArrayFactory.ForReferenceType itself does not directly depend on all of them, and it does not have a large number of direct dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
