```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from EqualsMethod shows a typical parent-child or usage relationship, and the outgoing dependencies are minimal and focused. This does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies with other abstractions."
