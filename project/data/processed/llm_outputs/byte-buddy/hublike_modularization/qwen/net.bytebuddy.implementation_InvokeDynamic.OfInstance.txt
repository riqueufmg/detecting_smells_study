{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription and Assigner, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies also indicates it is not a hub for other classes to depend on."
