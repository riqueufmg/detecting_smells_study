{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.StubMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'StubMethod' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class. Its outgoing dependencies include 'MethodReturn', 'InstrumentedType', 'DefaultValue', 'MethodDescription', 'Implementation', 'StackManipulation', and 'ByteCodeAppender', which indicates it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
