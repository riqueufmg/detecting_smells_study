    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForLoadedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.ForLoadedType' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypeDescription'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with a large number of abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
