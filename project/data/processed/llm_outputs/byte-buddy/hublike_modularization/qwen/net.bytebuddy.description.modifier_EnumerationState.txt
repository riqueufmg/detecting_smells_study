    "justification": "The class 'EnumerationState' has only one outgoing dependency to 'ModifierContributor' and a limited number of incoming dependencies from 'ByteBuddy', 'ModifierReviewable', and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
