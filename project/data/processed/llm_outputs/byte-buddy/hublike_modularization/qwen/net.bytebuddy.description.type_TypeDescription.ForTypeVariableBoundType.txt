    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeVariableBoundType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency is from a single class (TypeDescription) which itself has many dependencies, but this does not indicate that ForTypeVariableBoundType has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The outgoing dependencies are concentrated within the JavaDispatcher class and its inner classes, indicating a focused usage rather than broad dependency spread."
