    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor' has a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. It depends on 18 other abstractions directly (outgoing dependencies), and it is depended upon by 7 other abstractions (incoming dependencies). This extensive web of dependencies indicates that FieldAccessor acts as a hub within the module, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
