{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod.CompoundComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldDescription, SafeVarargsPlugin, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While these dependency targets themselves have multiple dependencies, the CompoundComparator class in isolation only maintains a limited number of direct relationships, which does not constitute a hub-like modularization smell."
