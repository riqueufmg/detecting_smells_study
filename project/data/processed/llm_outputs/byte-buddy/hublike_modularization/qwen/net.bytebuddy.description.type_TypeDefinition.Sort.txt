    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDefinition.Sort",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDefinition.Sort' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'JavaDispatcher', 'AccessControllerPlugin', and 'TypeDescription', and it is only depended on by 'TypeDefinition'. This level of dependency is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies in both directions."
