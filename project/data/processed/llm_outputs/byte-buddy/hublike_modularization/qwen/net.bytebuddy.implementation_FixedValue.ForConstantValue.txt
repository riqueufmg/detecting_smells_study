    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForConstantValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class FixedValue.ForConstantValue does not show hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies nor does it act as a central hub with many incoming and outgoing connections."
