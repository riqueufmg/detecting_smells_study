    "justification": "The class 'Discovery' has incoming dependencies from 3 other classes but no outgoing dependencies. While it is used by multiple classes, it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, which is a key characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The smell requires both incoming and outgoing dependencies to be excessive."
