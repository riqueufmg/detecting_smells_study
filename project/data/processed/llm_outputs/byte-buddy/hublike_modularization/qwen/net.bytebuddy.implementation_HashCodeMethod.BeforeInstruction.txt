    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which is not a large number of dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
