    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher.CreationAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from JavaDispatcher class. The incoming dependencies list shows JavaDispatcher depends on 16 classes, but this represents the dependencies of the referring class, not dependencies on the CreationAction class itself. The CreationAction class itself has no dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
