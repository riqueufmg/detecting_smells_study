    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Duplex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to two other classes (MethodDescription and TypeDescription) and no incoming dependencies. Although the dependent classes themselves have many dependencies, the class Binder.Duplex does not show a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) which would indicate Hub-like Modularization."
