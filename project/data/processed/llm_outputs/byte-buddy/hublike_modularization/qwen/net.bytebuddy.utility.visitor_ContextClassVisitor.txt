{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.ContextClassVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The incoming dependency is from a class (TypeWriter) that itself has a large number of dependencies (39), indicating it is a hub-like class. Additionally, the ContextClassVisitor is directly depended upon by such a complex class, suggesting it plays a central role in the module interaction, thus contributing to hub-like modularization."
