    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.Coordinate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ByteBuddyMojo, which is its enclosing class. The dependency list shows ByteBuddyMojo.Coordinate as one of many dependencies of ByteBuddyMojo, but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship, not multiple dependencies from different abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies."
