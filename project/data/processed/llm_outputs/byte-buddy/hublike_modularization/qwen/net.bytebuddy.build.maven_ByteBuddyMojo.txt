    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo' has outgoing dependencies to 14 different abstractions and incoming dependencies from at least 1 abstraction. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple components within the system."
