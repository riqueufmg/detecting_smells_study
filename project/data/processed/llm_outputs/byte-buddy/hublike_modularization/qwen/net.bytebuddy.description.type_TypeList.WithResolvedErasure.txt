    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) and no incoming dependencies. Although TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the WithResolvedErasure class does not directly depend on those, nor does it have a large number of direct dependencies itself. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal direct connections."
