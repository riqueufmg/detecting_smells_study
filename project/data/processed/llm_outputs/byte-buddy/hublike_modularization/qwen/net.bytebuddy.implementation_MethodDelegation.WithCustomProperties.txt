    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodDelegation.WithCustomProperties' has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('MethodDelegation'). The outgoing dependencies span multiple packages and involve core abstractions such as 'MethodDelegationBinder', 'TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder', 'TypeDescription', 'MethodGraph', and 'FieldLocator'. This wide range of dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system, thus exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
