{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForUpperBoundWildcard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypePool, TypeVariableSource, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeList. While TypePool itself has many dependencies (44), the ForUpperBoundWildcard class only directly depends on these 4 abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
