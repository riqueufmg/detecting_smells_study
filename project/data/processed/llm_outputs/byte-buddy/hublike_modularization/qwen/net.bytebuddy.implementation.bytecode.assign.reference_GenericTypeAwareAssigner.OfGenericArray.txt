    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (TypeDescription) and no incoming dependencies. Although TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the OfGenericArray class does not directly depend on those dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
