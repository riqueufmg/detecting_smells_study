    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForType' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to multiple classes including 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList' which itself has numerous dependencies such as 'TypeDescription', 'TypeDefinition', 'TypeVariableToken', etc. Additionally, it receives incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which depends on a large set of classes (over 40), indicating that 'ForType' is centrally involved in interactions with many other abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming relationships."
