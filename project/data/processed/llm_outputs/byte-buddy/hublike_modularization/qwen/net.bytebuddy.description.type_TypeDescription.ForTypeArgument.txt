    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, the TypeDescription.ForTypeArgument class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
