    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfFormalTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Although JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, the TypeDescription.OfFormalTypeVariable class only directly depends on these two classes, which is not a large number of dependencies."
