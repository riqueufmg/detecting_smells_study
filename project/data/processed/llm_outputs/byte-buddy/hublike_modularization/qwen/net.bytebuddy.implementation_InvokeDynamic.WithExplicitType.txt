    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithExplicitType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes in different packages: TypeDescription, StackManipulation, Assigner, and FieldLocator. While some of these dependency targets have extensive internal dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
