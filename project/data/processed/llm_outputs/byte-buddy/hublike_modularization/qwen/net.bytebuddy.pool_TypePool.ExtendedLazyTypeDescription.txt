    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeList, AsmClassReader, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that ExtendedLazyTypeDescription directly depends on all of them. The class does not show hub-like behavior with numerous direct dependencies."
