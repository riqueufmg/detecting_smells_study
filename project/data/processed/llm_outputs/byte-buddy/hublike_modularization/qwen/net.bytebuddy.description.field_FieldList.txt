{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FieldList has outgoing dependencies to 5 classes and incoming dependencies from 29 classes. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many abstractions rely on FieldList, and the outgoing dependencies show that FieldList interacts with multiple other abstractions. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
