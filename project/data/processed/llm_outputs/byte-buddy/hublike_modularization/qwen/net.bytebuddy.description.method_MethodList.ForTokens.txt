    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.ForTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.ForTokens' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'MethodDescription' and 'TypeDescription', each of which has numerous further dependencies, but this does not indicate that 'ForTokens' itself has direct dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not act as a central hub connecting to many other classes directly."
