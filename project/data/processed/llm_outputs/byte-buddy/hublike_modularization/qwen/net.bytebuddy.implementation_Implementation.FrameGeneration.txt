    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FrameGeneration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class 'Implementation'. The incoming dependency list shows 26 dependencies used by 'Implementation', but these are not dependencies of 'FrameGeneration' itself. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
