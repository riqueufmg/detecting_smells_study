{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Resolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Resolver' has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct classes: 'MethodDescription', 'MethodDelegationBinder', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'TypeDescription'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 classes: 'MethodDelegationBinder' and 'MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver'. This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with other abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
