    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.StaticFieldConstructor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.StaticFieldConstructor' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'MethodReturn', 'MethodDescription', 'ByteCodeAppender', and 'TypeDescription', each of which has a substantial number of further dependencies. The incoming dependency is from 'Binder', which itself has a large number of dependencies (34). This pattern of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
