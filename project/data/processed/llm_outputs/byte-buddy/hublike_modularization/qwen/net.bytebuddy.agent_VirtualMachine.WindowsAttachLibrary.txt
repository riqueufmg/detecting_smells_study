{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.WindowsAttachLibrary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows VirtualMachine references this class among 12 other classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for this specific class since it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
