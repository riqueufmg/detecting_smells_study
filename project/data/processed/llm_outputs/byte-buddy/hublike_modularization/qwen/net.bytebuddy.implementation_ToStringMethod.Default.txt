    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ToStringMethod.Default",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class ToStringMethod. The incoming dependency list shows ToStringMethod depending on multiple classes, but this represents the enclosing class's dependencies, not direct dependencies on Default. The Default class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal direct dependencies."
