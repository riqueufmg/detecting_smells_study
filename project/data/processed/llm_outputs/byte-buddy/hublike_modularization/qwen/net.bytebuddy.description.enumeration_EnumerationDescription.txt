    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'EnumerationDescription' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('TypeDescription' and 'CachedReturnPlugin') and incoming dependencies from 24 classes across multiple packages, indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of clients using it and dependencies it relies on. This pattern of extensive incoming and outgoing connections classifies it as hub-like modularization."
