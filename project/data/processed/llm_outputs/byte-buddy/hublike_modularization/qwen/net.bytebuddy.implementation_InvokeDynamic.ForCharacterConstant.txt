    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForCharacterConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner, TypeDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class ForCharacterConstant only directly depends on a small number of abstractions, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
