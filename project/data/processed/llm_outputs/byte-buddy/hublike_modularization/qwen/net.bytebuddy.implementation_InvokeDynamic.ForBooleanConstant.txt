    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.ForBooleanConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class InvokeDynamic.ForBooleanConstant only directly depends on these three abstractions, which is not a large number indicating hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior in terms of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
