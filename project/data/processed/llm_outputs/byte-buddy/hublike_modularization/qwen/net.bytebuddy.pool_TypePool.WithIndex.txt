    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithIndex' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which itself depends on many classes. However, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from other classes. Hence, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
