    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes in different packages, but the total number is not indicative of hub-like modularization. There is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would suggest hub-like behavior."
