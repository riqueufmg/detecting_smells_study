    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.ForLoadedFields",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription and no incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling, which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
