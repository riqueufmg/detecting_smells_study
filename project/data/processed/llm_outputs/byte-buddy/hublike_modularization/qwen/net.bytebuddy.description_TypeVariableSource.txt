{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.TypeVariableSource",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeVariableSource' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 24 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'TypeVariableSource' acts as a hub connecting numerous abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
