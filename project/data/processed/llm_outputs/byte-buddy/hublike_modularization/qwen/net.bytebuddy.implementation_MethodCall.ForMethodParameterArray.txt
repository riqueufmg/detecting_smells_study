    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForMethodParameterArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodCall.ForMethodParameterArray' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct classes across multiple packages including 'TypeDescription', 'Implementation', 'StackManipulation', 'Assigner', and 'ParameterList'. Additionally, it has significant incoming dependencies from the 'MethodCall' class, which itself depends on a large number of abstractions. The class acts as a central point connecting various core abstractions in the bytecode manipulation framework, handling method parameter arrays and bridging type descriptions, implementations, and stack manipulations, thereby creating a hub-like dependency structure."
