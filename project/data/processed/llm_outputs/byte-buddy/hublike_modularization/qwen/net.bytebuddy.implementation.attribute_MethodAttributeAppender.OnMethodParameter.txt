    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on AnnotationAppender which has multiple dependencies itself, the class in question does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous direct dependencies. The class appears to have a focused responsibility with limited coupling."
