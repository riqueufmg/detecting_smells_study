    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.SerializedConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'SerializedConstant' has only 8 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. A hub-like module typically exhibits a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, acting as a central point of communication. In this case, the class does not serve as a hub within the system."
