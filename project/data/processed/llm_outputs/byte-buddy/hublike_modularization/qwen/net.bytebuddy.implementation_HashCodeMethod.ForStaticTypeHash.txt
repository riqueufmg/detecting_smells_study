    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (StackManipulation and TypeDescription) and 1 incoming dependency (HashCodeMethod). The total number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
