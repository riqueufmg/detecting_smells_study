    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (TypeList) and 0 incoming dependencies. While the TypeList class itself has many outgoing dependencies (11), the WildcardUpperBoundTypeList class does not directly have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics as it has minimal direct connections."
