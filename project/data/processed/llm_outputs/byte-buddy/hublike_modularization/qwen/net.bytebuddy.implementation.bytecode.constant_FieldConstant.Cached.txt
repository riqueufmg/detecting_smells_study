    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.FieldConstant.Cached",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldConstant.Cached' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'StackManipulation', 'Implementation', and 'TypeDescription'. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing), which is the key indicator for Hub-like Modularization. Therefore, it does not qualify as a hub-like module based on the provided data."
