{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AsmClassReader' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 34 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'AsmClassReader' acts as a hub, connecting numerous abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
