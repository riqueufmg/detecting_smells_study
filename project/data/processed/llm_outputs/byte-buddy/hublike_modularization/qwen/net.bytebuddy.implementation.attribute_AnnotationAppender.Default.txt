    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationAppender.Default' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'AnnotationValueFilter', 'MethodDescription', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. The incoming dependency is from 'AnnotationAppender'. While 'MethodDescription' itself has many dependencies, this does not directly contribute to the hub-like nature of 'AnnotationAppender.Default'. The class does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies in either direction, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
