    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (44) to various abstractions within the same package and other packages, indicating hub-like modularization. It also serves as a central point for many other classes to depend on, as evidenced by its extensive use across the system. This central role with numerous dependencies classifies it as a hub."
