    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription' has outgoing dependencies to 64 other classes/interfaces within the same package and other packages, and it also appears as a dependency in the 'CachedReturnPlugin' class which itself depends on 20 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization where 'TypeDescription' acts as a central hub connecting to numerous other abstractions."
