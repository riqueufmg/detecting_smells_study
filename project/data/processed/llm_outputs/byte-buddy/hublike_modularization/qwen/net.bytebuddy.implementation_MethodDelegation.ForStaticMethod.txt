    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.ForStaticMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDelegationBinder and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While MethodDelegationBinder itself has many dependencies (17), the ForStaticMethod class only directly depends on these 2 abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
