    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Verifier",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Verifier' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('MethodDescription', 'Assigner', 'AnnotationSource') and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder'). The outgoing dependencies from 'MethodDescription' alone include 21 other classes, indicating a high number of transitive dependencies. This pattern of having numerous dependencies both incoming and outgoing classifies as Hub-like Modularization."
