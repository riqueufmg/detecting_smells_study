    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitTarget",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.WithImplicitTarget' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes, which in turn have numerous dependencies themselves. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic', which also has a large number of dependencies. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions, both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
