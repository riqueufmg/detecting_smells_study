    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription.ForLoadedMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodDescription.ForLoadedMethod' has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct classes across multiple packages, including 'TypeDescription', 'CachedReturnPlugin', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeList', 'ParameterList', 'AnnotationDescription', 'ParameterDescription', 'AnnotationValue', and 'AnnotationList'. This indicates a high number of outgoing dependencies to other abstractions. Additionally, the class is part of a package ('net.bytebuddy.description.method') that contains other highly connected classes such as 'MethodDescription' and 'ParameterDescription', which also exhibit hub-like dependency patterns. The presence of such extensive outgoing connections suggests that this class acts as a hub by interacting with numerous other abstractions."
