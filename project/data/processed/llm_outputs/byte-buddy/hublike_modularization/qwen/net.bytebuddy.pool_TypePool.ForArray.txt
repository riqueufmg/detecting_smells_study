    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypePool.ForArray' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypePool', 'AnnotationValue', and 'CachedReturnPlugin'. While 'TypePool' itself has many dependencies (49), the analysis must consider the class in isolation and not assume system-level context or the impact of dependencies of dependencies. The number of direct dependencies is not sufficiently large to qualify as hub-like modularization based on the provided data."
