    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodVariableAccess.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class MethodVariableAccess. The incoming dependencies list shows the enclosing class has dependencies with 11 other abstractions, but this does not indicate the NoOp class itself has hub-like modularization since it has minimal dependencies."
