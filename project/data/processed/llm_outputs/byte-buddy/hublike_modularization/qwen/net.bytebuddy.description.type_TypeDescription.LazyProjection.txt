    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.LazyProjection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.LazyProjection' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypeDescription'). The dependent class 'TypeDescription' itself has a large number of dependencies (39), indicating it is a hub. The 'LazyProjection' class is directly involved with a central, highly-connected abstraction ('TypeDescription') both in terms of incoming and outgoing connections, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
