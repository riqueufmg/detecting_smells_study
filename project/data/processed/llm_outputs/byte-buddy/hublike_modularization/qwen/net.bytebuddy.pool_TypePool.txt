        "It also has a significant number of incoming dependencies (83), with many classes from various packages like 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.*', 'net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.*', 'net.bytebuddy.asm.*', and others depending on it.",
        "This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'TypePool' is a central abstraction that interacts with a wide range of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
