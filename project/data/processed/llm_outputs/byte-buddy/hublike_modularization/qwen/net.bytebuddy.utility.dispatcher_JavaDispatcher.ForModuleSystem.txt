    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, meaning it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. A hub-like modularization smell requires significant incoming and outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions, which is not present here."
