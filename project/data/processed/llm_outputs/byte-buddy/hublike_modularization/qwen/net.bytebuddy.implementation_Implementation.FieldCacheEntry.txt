{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldCacheEntry",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing. Hub-like Modularization requires the abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
