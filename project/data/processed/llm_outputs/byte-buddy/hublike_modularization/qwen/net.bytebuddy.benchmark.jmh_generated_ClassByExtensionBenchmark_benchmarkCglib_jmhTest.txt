    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to ClassByExtensionBenchmark_jmhType and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
