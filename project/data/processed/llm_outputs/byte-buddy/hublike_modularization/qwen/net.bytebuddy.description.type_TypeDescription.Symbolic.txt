    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies include RecordComponentDescription, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, AnnotationSource, TypeList, and StackSize. Each of these dependent classes also has multiple dependencies, indicating that TypeDescription.Symbolic connects to a large number of abstractions through its direct dependencies."
