        "The class 'MethodCall' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (46 unique classes) which indicates it interacts with many other abstractions.",
        "The class 'MethodCall' has multiple nested classes (e.g., ForConstructingInvocation, ForContextualInvocation, Resolved, Factory, ArgumentLoader, etc.) that also have their own dependencies, increasing the overall coupling.",
        "The class 'MethodCall' appears in the dependencies of several other classes (incoming dependencies from 7 different classes), showing that it is widely used.",
        "Many of the dependencies are from different packages within the system, suggesting broad interaction across module boundaries.",
        "The presence of numerous static factory methods and nested builder-like classes suggests centralization of creation logic, contributing to hub-like behavior."
