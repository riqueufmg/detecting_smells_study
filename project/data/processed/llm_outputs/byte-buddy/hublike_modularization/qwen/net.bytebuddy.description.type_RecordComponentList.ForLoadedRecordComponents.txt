    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to RecordComponentDescription and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency RecordComponentDescription has multiple dependencies itself, but the analyzed class ForLoadedRecordComponents does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependencies."
