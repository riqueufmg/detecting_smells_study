    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ByteCodeElement' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions: TypeDescription, ModifierReviewable, NamedElement, FilterableList, and DeclaredByType. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 39 different abstractions across multiple packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.matcher', 'net.bytebuddy.asm', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ByteCodeElement' acts as a hub connecting a large number of other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
