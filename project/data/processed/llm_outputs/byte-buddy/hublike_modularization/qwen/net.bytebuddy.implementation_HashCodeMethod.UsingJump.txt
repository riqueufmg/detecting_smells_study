    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.UsingJump' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'StackManipulation', 'MethodDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'TypeDescription'. While some of these dependencies like 'MethodDescription' and 'TypeDescription' have extensive internal dependencies, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor does it serve as a hub for incoming dependencies. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
