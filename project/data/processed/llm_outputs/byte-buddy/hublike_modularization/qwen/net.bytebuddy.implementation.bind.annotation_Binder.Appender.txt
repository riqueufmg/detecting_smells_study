    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Appender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.Appender' has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct classes across multiple packages. This indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it shows a high level of coupling to various parts of the system through its dependencies, further supporting the detection."
