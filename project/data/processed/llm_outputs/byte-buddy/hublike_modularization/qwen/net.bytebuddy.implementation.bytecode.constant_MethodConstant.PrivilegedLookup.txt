    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.MethodConstant.PrivilegedLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeDescription, MethodDescription, Duplication, Implementation, and StackManipulation. While some of these dependencies themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The number of dependencies is not excessive for typical Java classes, and there are no incoming dependencies indicating other classes rely heavily on this class."
