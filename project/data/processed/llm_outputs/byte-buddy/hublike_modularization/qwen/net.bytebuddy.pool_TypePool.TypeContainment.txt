    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (2 classes: MethodDescription and TypeDescription) and incoming dependencies (1 class: TypePool). The dependencies are not extensive enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
