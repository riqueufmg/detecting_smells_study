    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationRetention",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationRetention' has no outgoing dependencies and is only listed as a dependency in the incoming dependencies of multiple classes. While it is used by many classes, it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, which is a key characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The smell requires both incoming and outgoing dependencies to be excessive, but this class only exhibits incoming dependencies without creating a hub of outgoing connections."
