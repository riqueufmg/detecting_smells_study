    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodAccessorFactory.Illegal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription' and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation', which are single classes, not a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
