```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyTypeDescription",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypePool.LazyTypeDescription' has outgoing dependencies to 22 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypePool'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, its central role in the dependency structure (being referenced by TypePool and referencing many core description classes) reinforces this pattern."
