    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldLocator, MethodDescription, and Assigner, each of which have their own set of dependencies, but the AbstractDelegator itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions."
