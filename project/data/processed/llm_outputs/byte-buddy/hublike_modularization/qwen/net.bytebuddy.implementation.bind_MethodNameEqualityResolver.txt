    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (2 direct dependencies) and incoming dependencies (2 incoming references). The outgoing dependencies themselves have many internal dependencies, but those are not counted towards the hub-like characteristic of the analyzed class. The class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction, thus it is not hub-like."
