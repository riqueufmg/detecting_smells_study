    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Implicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 0 incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
