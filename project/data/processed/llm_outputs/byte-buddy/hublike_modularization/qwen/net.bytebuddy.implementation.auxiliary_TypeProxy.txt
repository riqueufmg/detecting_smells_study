    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeProxy' has outgoing dependencies to 18 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'TypeProxy' acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
