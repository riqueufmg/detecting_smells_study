    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (7) and no incoming dependencies. The dependencies are focused on core abstractions related to bytecode manipulation and type descriptions, but the count and scope do not indicate hub-like modularization. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependency relationships that would classify it as a hub."
