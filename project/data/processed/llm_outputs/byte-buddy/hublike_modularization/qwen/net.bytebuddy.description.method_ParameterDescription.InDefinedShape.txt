    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterDescription.InDefinedShape' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('MethodDescription' and 'ParameterDescription'), each of which has a large number of further dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'ParameterDescription', which also has a significant number of dependencies. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions with complex dependency chains, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
