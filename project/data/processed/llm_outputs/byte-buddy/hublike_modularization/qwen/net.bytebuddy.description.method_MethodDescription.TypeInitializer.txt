    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies to other classes. There are no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization, especially considering the class might be part of a complex but well-structured library like ByteBuddy. No evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like behavior."
