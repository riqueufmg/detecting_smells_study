    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForAnnotationProperty' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
