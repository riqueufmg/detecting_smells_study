{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.OfField' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'FieldLocator', 'MethodDescription', and 'Assigner', each of which has multiple further dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself. Hub-like modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
