{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Generic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.Generic' has outgoing dependencies to 20 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the incoming dependencies show that other classes rely heavily on this class, further supporting the presence of this smell."
