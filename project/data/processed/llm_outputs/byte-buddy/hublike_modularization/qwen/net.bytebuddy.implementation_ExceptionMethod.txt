{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.ExceptionMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.ExceptionMethod' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 1 other abstraction ('net.bytebuddy.asm.ClassVisitorFactory'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, its nested class 'ConstructionDelegate' also exhibits a significant number of dependencies, further contributing to the hub-like structure."
