    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_baseline_jmhTest",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'TrivialClassCreationBenchmark_jmhType' and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
