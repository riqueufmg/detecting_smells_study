    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ParameterLengthResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 2 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription (with many sub-dependencies) and MethodDelegationBinder (with many sub-dependencies), but these are counted as single dependencies each. The incoming dependencies come from MethodDelegationBinder and MethodDelegationBinder.AmbiguityResolver. This level of dependency does not constitute hub-like modularization."
