    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyJarsTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ByteBuddyJarsTask' has outgoing dependencies on 34 classes/interfaces within the 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin' abstraction and additional dependencies on other core ByteBuddy components. It also has incoming dependencies from at least one other class ('ByteBuddyJarsTaskExtension'). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions."
