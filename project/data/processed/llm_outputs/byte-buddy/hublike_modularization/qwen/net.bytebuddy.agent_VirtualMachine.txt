{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions within the system."
