    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.WithFixedSuffix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AuxiliaryType, ClassFileVersion, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which is not a large number of dependencies. There are no incoming dependencies from other classes. This does not constitute hub-like modularization as the dependency count is low and there is no central dependency relationship."
