    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.FieldTokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldList and FieldDescription, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the TypePool.FieldTokenList class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
