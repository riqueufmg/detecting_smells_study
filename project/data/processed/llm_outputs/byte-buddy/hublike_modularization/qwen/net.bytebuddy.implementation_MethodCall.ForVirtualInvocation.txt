    "justification": "The class 'MethodCall.ForVirtualInvocation' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Implementation', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'TypeDescription'. The only incoming dependency is from 'MethodCall'. The class does not exhibit a high number of dependencies in either direction, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Therefore, it does not qualify as a hub-like module based on the provided dependency data."
