    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldDescription, FilterableList, and ByteCodeElement, which are directly related to its functionality as a field list implementation. The dependencies do not indicate a large number of interactions with other abstractions that would characterize hub-like modularization."
