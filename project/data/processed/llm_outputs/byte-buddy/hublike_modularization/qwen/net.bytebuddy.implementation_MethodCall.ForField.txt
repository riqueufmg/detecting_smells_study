    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForField' has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall') which itself has a large number of dependencies (39). This indicates that 'ForField' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, both in terms of its direct dependencies and its role within a highly interconnected structure."
