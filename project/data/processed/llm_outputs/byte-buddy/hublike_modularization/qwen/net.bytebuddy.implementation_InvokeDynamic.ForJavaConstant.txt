    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and ConstantValue classes. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies themselves, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
