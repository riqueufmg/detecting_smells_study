{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows VirtualMachine depends on multiple classes including this one, but this Factory class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It appears to be a simple factory class with limited coupling."
