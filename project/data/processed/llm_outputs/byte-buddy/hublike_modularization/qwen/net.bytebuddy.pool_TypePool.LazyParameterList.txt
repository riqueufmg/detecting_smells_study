{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyParameterList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ParameterList, ParameterDescription, and TypeList, each of which has a moderate number of their own dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like behavior for the analyzed class itself. Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
