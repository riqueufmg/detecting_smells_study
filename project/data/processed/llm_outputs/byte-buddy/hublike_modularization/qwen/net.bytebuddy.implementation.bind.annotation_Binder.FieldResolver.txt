    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.FieldResolver' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 3 major classes (MethodDescription, DynamicType, TypeDescription), each of which has a large number of further dependencies (20, 60, and 50+ respectively). Additionally, it has significant incoming dependencies from 'Binder' class which itself depends on over 40 other abstractions. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like behavior where this class acts as a central point connecting numerous other components."
