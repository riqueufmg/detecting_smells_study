    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForElementMatcher' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes ('net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher', 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.MethodGraph', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'), each of which also has a large number of further dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall', which itself depends on a vast array of 60+ elements. This central position with numerous incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like behavior."
