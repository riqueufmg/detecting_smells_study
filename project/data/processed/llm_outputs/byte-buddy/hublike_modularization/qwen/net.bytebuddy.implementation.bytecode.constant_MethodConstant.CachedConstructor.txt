    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and TypeDescription, each of which have numerous dependencies themselves, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions."
