{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ByteBuddyTask",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ByteBuddyTask' has outgoing dependencies to 4 different classes and incoming dependencies from 2 different classes. The outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin' involves a large number of sub-dependencies (34), indicating a high level of interconnectedness. This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies, especially with one dependency having numerous sub-dependencies, suggests hub-like modularization where 'ByteBuddyTask' acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
