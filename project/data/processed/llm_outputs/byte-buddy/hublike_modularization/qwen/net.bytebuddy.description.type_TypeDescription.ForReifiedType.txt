    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.ForReifiedType' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes: MethodDescription, MethodList, FieldList, FieldDescription, TypeList, and AnnotationList. Additionally, these dependent classes themselves have numerous outgoing dependencies, indicating that this class acts as a hub connecting to a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This creates a central point of dependency, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
