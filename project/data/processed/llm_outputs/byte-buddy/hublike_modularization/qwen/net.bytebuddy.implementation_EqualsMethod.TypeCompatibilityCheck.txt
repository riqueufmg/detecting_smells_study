    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class 'EqualsMethod'. The dependencies are focused on specific bytecode manipulation and type description abstractions, which is typical for this kind of implementation class. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics as it does not connect to a large number of different abstractions in the system."
