    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from AsmClassWriter, which is its enclosing class. The incoming dependencies list shows AsmClassWriter depending on multiple classes, but this represents the enclosing class's dependencies, not dependencies on this EmptyAsmClassReader class. The class itself has minimal dependency relationships."
