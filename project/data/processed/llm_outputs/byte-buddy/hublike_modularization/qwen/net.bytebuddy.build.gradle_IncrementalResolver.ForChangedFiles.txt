    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.IncrementalResolver.ForChangedFiles",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to org.gradle.work.ChangeType and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (only 1 outgoing, 0 incoming) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as there are not dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
