    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.ForConfiguredPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 34 classes/interfaces in the 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin' abstraction and an additional outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.maven.Transformation', making a total of 35 outgoing dependencies. Although it has no incoming dependencies, the large number of outgoing dependencies to a wide range of abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
