    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of outgoing dependencies (16) through its dependency on JavaDispatcher, which itself has many outgoing dependencies (15). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from AsmClassWriter which also has a high number of dependencies (14). This pattern of multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with numerous abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
