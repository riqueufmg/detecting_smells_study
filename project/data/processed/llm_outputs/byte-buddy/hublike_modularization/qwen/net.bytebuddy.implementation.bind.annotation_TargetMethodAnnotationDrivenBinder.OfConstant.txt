    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.OfConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on AnnotationDescription which has many dependencies itself, the class in question does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
