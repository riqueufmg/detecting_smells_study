{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ShiftRight",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ShiftRight' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'StackManipulation', 'ShiftRight.Unsigned', 'StackSize', and 'Implementation'. While 'Implementation' has many dependencies, this does not make 'ShiftRight' a hub-like module because the metric for hub-like modularization should be based on the number of direct dependencies of the class in question, not the dependencies of its dependencies. The class 'ShiftRight' itself does not exhibit a large number of dependencies."
