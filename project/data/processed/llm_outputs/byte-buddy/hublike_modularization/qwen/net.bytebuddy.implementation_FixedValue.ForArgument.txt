    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForArgument",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation and Assigner, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
