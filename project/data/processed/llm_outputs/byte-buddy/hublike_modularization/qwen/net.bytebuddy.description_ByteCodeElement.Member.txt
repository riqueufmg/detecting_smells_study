{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement.Member",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (DeclaredByType and NamedElement) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
