    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ByteBuddyMojo.Transformer' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of outgoing dependencies (2 total outgoing dependencies targeting 35 unique classes) and incoming dependencies (1 incoming dependency from 'ByteBuddyMojo' with 11 unique class dependencies). This central role in managing numerous dependencies indicates it acts as a hub within the module, violating modularization principles by creating a tightly coupled abstraction."
