    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Initialization' has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ClassLoaderResolver and EntryPoint) and 1 incoming dependency from ByteBuddyMojo. While it connects to EntryPoint which has many outgoing dependencies, the Initialization class itself does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction. The dependency pattern does not indicate hub-like modularization for this class in isolation."
