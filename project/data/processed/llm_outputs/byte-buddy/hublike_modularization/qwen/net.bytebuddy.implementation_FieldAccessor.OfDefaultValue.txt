    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.OfDefaultValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to Assigner and no incoming dependencies. The dependency graph shows limited connections, not indicating hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
