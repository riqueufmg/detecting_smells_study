    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.Visibility",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Visibility' has incoming dependencies from 44 other classes and 1 outgoing dependency. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions rely on it, which is a strong indicator of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, its central role in representing visibility modifiers suggests it is a key abstraction that other parts of the system depend on, further supporting the detection of this smell."
