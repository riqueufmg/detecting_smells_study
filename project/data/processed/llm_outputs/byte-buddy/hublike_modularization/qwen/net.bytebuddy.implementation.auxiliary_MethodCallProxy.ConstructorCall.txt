    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4 distinct classes) and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class. The dependencies are focused on related bytecode manipulation and method description functionality, which is expected for a specialized auxiliary class. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
