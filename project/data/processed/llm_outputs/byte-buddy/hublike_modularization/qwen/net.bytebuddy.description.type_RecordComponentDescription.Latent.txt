```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentDescription.Latent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeDescription and AnnotationList, which themselves have many dependencies, but the Latent class does not directly depend on all of those. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
