    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodDelegation' has outgoing dependencies to 20 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with a large number of abstractions, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
