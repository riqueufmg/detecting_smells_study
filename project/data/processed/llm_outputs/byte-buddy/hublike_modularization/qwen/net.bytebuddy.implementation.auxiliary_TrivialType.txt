    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TrivialType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TrivialType has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (7) and incoming dependencies (2). The outgoing dependencies are to core ByteBuddy abstractions related to dynamic type creation and scaffolding, and the incoming dependencies originate from method rebase resolution logic. The number of dependencies is not excessive for its role as an auxiliary type, and it does not exhibit hub-like characteristics by having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions in a centralizing manner."
