{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ReaderMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which itself depends on many other classes. However, the class 'TypePool.ReaderMode' does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from different sources. The single incoming dependency is from one class that has many dependencies, but this does not make 'TypePool.ReaderMode' hub-like in its own right."
