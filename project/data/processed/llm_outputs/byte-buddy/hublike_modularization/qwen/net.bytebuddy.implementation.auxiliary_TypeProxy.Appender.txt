    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeProxy.Appender' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions: 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'Implementation', 'StackManipulation', and 'MethodAccessorFactory'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies (though not listed in detail) which contribute to its hub-like characteristic. The number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is large relative to the typical scope of a class, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
