    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher, AnnotationDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which is the enclosing class. While AnnotationDescription has many dependencies, those are not direct dependencies of the analyzed class. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a limited number of direct dependencies."
