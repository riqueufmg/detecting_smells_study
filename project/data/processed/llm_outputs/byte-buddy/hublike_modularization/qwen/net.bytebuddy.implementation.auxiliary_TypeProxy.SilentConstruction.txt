{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy.SilentConstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. The incoming dependency is from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.TypeProxy'. This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as the class is not interacting with a large number of other abstractions."
