    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ArrayFactory.ArrayCreator' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies) and only one incoming dependency from 'ArrayFactory'. The dependencies are focused and do not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit high connectivity that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
