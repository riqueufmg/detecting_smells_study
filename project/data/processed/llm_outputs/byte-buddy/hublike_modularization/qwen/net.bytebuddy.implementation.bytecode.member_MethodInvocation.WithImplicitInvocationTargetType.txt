    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.WithImplicitInvocationTargetType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from MethodInvocation class. The incoming dependency shows MethodInvocation class depends on this class along with 10 other classes/types, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for WithImplicitInvocationTargetType itself. The class appears to be a specialized component with limited dependencies rather than a central hub."
