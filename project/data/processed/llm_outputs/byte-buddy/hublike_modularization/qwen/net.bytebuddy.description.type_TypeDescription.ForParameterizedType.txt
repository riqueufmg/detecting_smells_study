    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin and TypeList. While TypeList itself has many dependencies (11), this represents a single dependency relationship from the analyzed class perspective, not multiple direct dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous direct dependencies in either direction."
