```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.MacLibrary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows VirtualMachine depends on multiple libraries including MacLibrary, but this represents a typical dependency structure where a factory/manager class depends on several implementation classes, not hub-like modularization where the class itself would have many dependencies."
