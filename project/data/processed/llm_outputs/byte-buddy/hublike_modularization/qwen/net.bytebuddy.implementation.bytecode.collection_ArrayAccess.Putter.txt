    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection.ArrayAccess.Putter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While the Implementation class has many dependencies, the ArrayAccess.Putter class itself does not directly depend on those classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
