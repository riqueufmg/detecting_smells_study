    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Factory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.Factory' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('MethodDescription', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'TypeDescription') and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('Binder') which itself has a large number of dependencies (35). Additionally, the outgoing dependencies ('MethodDescription' and 'TypeDescription') each have a high number of their own dependencies (21 and 51 respectively), indicating that 'Binder.Factory' is connected to abstractions with extensive dependency networks, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
