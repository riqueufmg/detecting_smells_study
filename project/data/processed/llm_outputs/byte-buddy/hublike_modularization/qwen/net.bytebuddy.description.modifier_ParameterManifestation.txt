    "justification": "The class 'ParameterManifestation' has incoming dependencies from 'ModifierReviewable' and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase', each depending on 15 other classes including 'ParameterManifestation'. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'ModifierContributor', which itself has further dependencies. This pattern of multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
