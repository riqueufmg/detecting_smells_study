    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.Unresolved",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.Unresolved' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (114) to various classes within the 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' package and its sub-packages, indicating it interacts with many different abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'Binder' class which itself has a large number of dependencies (61), suggesting that 'Binder.Unresolved' is a central point of interaction between multiple components. This pattern of having numerous both incoming and outgoing connections characterizes Hub-like Modularization."
