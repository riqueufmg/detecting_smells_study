    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatchers, ClassLoadingStrategy, and TypeValidation, which are reasonable for a benchmark class in this context. None of the dependencies show excessive coupling or hub-like behavior in isolation."
