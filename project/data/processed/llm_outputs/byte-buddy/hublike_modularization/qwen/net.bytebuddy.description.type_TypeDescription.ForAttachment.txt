    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription' has a large number of outgoing dependencies (more than 50) and also appears as a dependency in the 'TypeVariableSource' class, indicating it is central to many abstractions. This central role with numerous dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
