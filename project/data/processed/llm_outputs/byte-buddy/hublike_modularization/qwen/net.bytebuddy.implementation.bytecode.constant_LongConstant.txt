    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.constant.LongConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'LongConstant' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency from 'DefaultValue'. The dependencies are focused within the bytecode constant and stack manipulation domain, and do not exhibit a hub-like pattern where a single class interacts with a large number of diverse abstractions. The class does not act as a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections."
