    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies) and only one incoming dependency. The dependencies are focused on related abstractions within the same package and immediate neighboring packages. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependency relationships that would indicate hub-like modularization."
