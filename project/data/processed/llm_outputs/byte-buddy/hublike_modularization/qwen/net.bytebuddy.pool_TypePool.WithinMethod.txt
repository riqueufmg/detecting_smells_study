{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.WithinMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While MethodDescription itself has many dependencies, the TypePool.WithinMethod class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The low number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization."
