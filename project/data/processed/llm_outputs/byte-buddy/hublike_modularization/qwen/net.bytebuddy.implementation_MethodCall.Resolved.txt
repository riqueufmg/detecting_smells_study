    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Resolved",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodCall.Resolved' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes across multiple packages, including 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'Duplication', 'StackManipulation', 'Assigner', and 'ParameterDescription'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'MethodCall' class, which itself has a large number of dependencies (35). The class acts as a central point connecting various abstractions in the bytecode implementation, handling method calls, type descriptions, stack manipulations, and assigners, thereby creating a hub with numerous interconnections."
