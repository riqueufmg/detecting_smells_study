    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AnnotationDescription and TypeDescription, which themselves have many dependencies, but the TypePool.Simple class does not directly depend on all of those. The number of direct dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
