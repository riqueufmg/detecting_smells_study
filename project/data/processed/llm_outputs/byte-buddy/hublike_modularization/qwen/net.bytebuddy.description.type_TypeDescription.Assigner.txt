{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Assigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.Assigner' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from 'TypeDescription'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization typically involves a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions, which is not the case here."
