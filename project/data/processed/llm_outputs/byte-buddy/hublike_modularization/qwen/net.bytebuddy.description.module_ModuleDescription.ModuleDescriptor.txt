{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.ModuleDescriptor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependency is to JavaDispatcher which has many dependencies, but that does not indicate hub-like modularization for this class. The incoming dependency is from ModuleDescription which also has many dependencies, but again this does not make ModuleDescriptor a hub. Hub-like modularization requires the class itself to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
