    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackSize' has incoming dependencies from 68 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes, making a total of 70 dependencies. This high number of dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, indicates that the class acts as a hub connecting numerous other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
