    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeCasting' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5 classes) and incoming dependencies (2 classes). The dependencies are focused within the bytecode and type assignment domain, and the class does not exhibit a high number of interactions with diverse abstractions. Therefore, it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
