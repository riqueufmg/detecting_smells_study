    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic.Target' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 classes, which in turn have numerous further dependencies, creating a wide-reaching dependency chain. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvokeDynamic', which itself depends on a large number of abstractions. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple complex modules, thereby forming a hub in the modular structure."
