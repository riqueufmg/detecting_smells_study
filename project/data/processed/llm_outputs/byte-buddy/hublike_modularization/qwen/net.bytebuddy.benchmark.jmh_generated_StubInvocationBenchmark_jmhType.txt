    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated.StubInvocationBenchmark_jmhType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 5 incoming dependencies from test classes. While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the number is not excessively large and all dependencies are from related test classes within the same package, which is typical for JMH benchmark generated code. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions."
