    "justification": "The class AndroidClassLoadingStrategy has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions within the same package, including RandomString from another package. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central coordinator interacting with multiple other components."
