    "justification": "The class 'Multiplication' has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Implementation and StackSize) and 2 incoming dependencies (HashCodeMethod and HashCodeMethod.Appender). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
