    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Latent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.Latent' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', and 'TypeList', which themselves have extensive dependency lists. This pattern of having a central class with numerous outgoing connections to other significant classes indicates hub-like modularization."
