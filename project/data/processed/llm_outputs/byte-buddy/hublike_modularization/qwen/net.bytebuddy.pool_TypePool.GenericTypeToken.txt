    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.GenericTypeToken' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', 'TypeList', and 'TypePool', indicating a central role in type resolution and management. The incoming dependencies originate from 'TypePool', which is a central abstraction in the pooling mechanism. This pattern of having multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies with key abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
