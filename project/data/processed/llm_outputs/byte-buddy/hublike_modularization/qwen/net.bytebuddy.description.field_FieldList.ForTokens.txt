    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldList.ForTokens' has only two outgoing dependencies ('net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
