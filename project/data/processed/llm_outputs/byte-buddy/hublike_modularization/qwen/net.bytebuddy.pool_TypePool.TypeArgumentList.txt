    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency target itself has multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class TypePool.TypeArgumentList does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal direct dependencies."
