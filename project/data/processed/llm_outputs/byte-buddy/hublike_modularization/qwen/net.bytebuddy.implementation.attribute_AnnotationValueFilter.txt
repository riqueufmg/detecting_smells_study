    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.AnnotationValueFilter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationValueFilter' has incoming dependencies from 34 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, and the outgoing dependencies show that it interacts with multiple other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
