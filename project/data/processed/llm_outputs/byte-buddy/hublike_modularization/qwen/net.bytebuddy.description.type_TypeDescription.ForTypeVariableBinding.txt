{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForTypeVariableBinding",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription, TypeVariableSource, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeList. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies, the class itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies, thus not exhibiting hub-like modularization."
