    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.ForWildcardLowerBoundType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. Although JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class does not directly depend on those, thus it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
