    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForContextualInvocation' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies. It has incoming dependencies from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall', which itself has a large number of dependencies. Additionally, its outgoing dependencies include 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', both of which have numerous dependencies themselves, indicating that 'ForContextualInvocation' acts as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
