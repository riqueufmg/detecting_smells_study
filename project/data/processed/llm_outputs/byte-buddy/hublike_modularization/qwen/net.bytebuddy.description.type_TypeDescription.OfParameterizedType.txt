{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.OfParameterizedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.OfParameterizedType' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypeDescription'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with many different abstractions, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
