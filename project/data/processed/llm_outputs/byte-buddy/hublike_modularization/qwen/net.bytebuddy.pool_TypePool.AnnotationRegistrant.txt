    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which itself lists many dependencies but does not indicate a direct hub-like relationship with the analyzed class. The number of dependencies alone does not establish hub-like modularization without bidirectional or extensive outgoing connections."
