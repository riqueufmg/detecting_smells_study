{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodReturn, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, Implementation, and StackManipulation. While some of these classes (like TypeDescription and Implementation) have many dependencies themselves, the FieldAccessor.Appender class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a relatively small number of direct dependencies and no incoming dependencies."
