    "justification": "The class 'TypeProxy.Default' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of outgoing dependencies (26) and incoming dependencies (15). It depends on numerous classes in the 'net.bytebuddy.implementation' package and is itself depended upon by 'TypeProxy', indicating it acts as a central hub connecting multiple abstractions."
