{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForNullValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from FixedValue class shows it depends on many classes, but that indicates FixedValue is the hub, not ForNullValue. ForNullValue itself does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
