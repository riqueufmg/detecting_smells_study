    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.agent.Attacher' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent', which itself depends on 21 classes. The number of dependencies involving 'Attacher' is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
