    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to MethodDescription which itself has many dependencies, but the ForUnresolvedMethod class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
