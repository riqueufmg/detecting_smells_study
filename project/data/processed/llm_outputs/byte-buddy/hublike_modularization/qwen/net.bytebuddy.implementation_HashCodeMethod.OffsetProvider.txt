    "justification": "The class 'HashCodeMethod.OffsetProvider' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies) and only one incoming dependency from 'HashCodeMethod'. The dependencies are focused and related to its functionality within the hash code generation mechanism. There is no evidence of excessive or widespread dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
