    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class InvokeDynamic.ForThisInstance does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a limited number of direct dependencies and no incoming dependencies."
