    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (9) and only one incoming dependency (from MethodCall). The dependencies are focused within the same package and related scaffolding packages, which is typical for factory classes. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
