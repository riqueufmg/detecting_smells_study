    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.Bound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Implementation, Assigner, AnnotationDescription, and ParameterDescription, which are reasonable for its functionality as a binder. The number of dependencies is not excessive for this type of class, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous connections."
