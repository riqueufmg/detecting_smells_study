{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other abstractions. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, making it a central hub in the system."
