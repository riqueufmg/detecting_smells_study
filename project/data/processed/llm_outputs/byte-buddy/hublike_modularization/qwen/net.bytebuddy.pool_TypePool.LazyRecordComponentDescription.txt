    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyRecordComponentDescription",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency and 1 outgoing dependency. The outgoing dependency to RecordComponentDescription has 12 dependencies, but this represents a single dependency relationship from the analyzed class perspective. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has minimal connections to other abstractions."
