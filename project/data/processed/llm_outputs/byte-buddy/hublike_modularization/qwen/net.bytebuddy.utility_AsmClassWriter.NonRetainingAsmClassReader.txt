    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.NonRetainingAsmClassReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to AsmClassReader and no incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
