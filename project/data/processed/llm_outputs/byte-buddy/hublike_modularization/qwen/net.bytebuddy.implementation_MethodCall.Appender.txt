    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.Appender' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodReturn', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation', 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.StackManipulation'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction: 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall', which itself has a large number of dependencies. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
