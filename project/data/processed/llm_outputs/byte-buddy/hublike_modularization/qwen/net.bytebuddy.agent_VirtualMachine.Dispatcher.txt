{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.Dispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows that VirtualMachine depends on this class along with 11 other classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the Dispatcher class itself since it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
