    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule.Resolver' has only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.utility.dispatcher.JavaDispatcher' and one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a hub with numerous connections to many other abstractions."
