    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeList, TypeDescription, and AnnotationList, which are relatively few and focused. There is no evidence of excessive dependencies in either direction that would indicate hub-like modularization."
