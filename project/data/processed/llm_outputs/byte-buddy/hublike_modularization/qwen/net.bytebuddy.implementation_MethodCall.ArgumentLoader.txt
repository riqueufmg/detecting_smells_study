    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ArgumentLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ArgumentLoader' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall'). The class interacts with a wide variety of abstractions across different packages including 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold', 'net.bytebuddy.description.type', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode', and 'net.bytebuddy.utility'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
