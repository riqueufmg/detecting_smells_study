    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, indicating it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It only has a dependency on net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin which appears to be a plugin annotation rather than a runtime dependency."
