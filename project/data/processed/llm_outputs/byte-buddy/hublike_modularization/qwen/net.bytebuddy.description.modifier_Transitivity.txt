    "justification": "The class 'Transitivity' has only one outgoing dependency to 'ModifierContributor' and is listed among the dependencies of two incoming classes ('ModifierReviewable' and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase'), but the number of dependencies is not excessively large. The class does not exhibit a hub-like pattern where it connects to a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
