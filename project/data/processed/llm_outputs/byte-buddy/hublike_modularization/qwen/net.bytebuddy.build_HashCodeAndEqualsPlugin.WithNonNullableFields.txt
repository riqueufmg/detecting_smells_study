    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, indicating it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It only has a dependency relationship with its outer class HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, which is a normal nested class relationship rather than hub-like modularization."
