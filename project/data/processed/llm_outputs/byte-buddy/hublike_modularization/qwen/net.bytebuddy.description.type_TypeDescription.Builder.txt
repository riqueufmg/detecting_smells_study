    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.Builder' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes, and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'TypeList' which itself has 11 dependencies, 'TypeDescription' which has 65 dependencies, and 'AnnotationList' which has 5 dependencies. Additionally, the incoming dependencies show that 'TypeDescription' depends on this class along with 65 other dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates that the class acts as a hub within the module, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
