    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.module.ModuleDescription.Opens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ModuleDescription.Opens' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ModifierReviewable' and 'JavaDispatcher', each of which has multiple further dependencies, but this does not indicate that 'ModuleDescription.Opens' itself has direct dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The incoming dependency is from 'ModuleDescription', which also does not suggest hub-like behavior for 'ModuleDescription.Opens'. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
