    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForField' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and is depended upon by only 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool') which itself has numerous dependencies. However, the class in question does not exhibit a high number of direct incoming or outgoing dependencies, thus it does not qualify as a hub-like module based on the provided dependency information."
