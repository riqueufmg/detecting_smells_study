    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (MethodDescription, FieldDescription, RecordComponentDescription, TypeList) and each of these classes also has a large number of outgoing dependencies (ranging from 9 to 21), indicating hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions."
