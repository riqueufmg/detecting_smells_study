    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForMissingValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationValue.ForMissingValue' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes: 'AnnotationValue', 'MethodDescription', and 'TypeDescription'. While these dependency targets themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not show a pattern of having dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has no incoming dependencies, which further reduces its connectivity within the system. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
