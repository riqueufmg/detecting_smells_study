    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.NullValueGuard",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to TypeDescription, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, and StackSize. The incoming dependencies are from HashCodeMethod. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
