    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.visitor.LocalVariableAwareMethodVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodDescription' and 'net.bytebuddy.utility.OpenedClassReader', which are reasonable and limited in number. There is no evidence of excessive dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
