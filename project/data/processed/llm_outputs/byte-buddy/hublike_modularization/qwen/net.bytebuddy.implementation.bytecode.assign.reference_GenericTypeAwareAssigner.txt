{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.reference.GenericTypeAwareAssigner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to core abstractions like TypeDescription, StackManipulation, TypeList, and TypeCasting which are expected in a bytecode manipulation library. The incoming dependency is from Assigner which is in the same package. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have excessive dependencies with many other abstractions."
