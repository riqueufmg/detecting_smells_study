    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldGetter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.FieldGetter' has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes across multiple packages. Additionally, the outgoing dependencies from these classes reveal a wide range of further dependencies (e.g., TypeDescription has 40+ dependencies), indicating that FieldGetter interacts with a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This extensive web of dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
