    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentTypeEvaluator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ByteBuddyAgent, which is its enclosing class. The incoming dependencies list shows ByteBuddyAgent depending on multiple classes, but this does not indicate that AttachmentTypeEvaluator itself has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
