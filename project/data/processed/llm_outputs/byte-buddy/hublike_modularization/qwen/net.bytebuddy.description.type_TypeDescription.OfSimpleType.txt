    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.OfSimpleType' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes: 'RecordComponentDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', 'TypeList', and 'StackSize'. Among these, 'TypeDescription' has a very high number of outgoing dependencies (49), indicating it is a hub. Additionally, 'MethodDescription' (23 dependencies), 'TypeList' (10 dependencies), and 'FieldDescription' (9 dependencies) also exhibit high outgoing dependency counts. The presence of such highly connected abstractions both as outgoing dependencies and the overall connectivity of this class indicates hub-like modularization."
