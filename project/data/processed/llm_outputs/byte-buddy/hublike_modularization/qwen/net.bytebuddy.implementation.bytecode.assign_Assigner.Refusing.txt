    "justification": "The class 'Assigner.Refusing' has only two outgoing dependencies ('StackManipulation' and 'TypeDescription') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
