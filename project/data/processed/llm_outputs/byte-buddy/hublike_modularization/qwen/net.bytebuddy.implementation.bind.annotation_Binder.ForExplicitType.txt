    "justification": "The class 'Binder.ForExplicitType' has only outgoing dependencies to two distinct classes ('Implementation' and 'TypeDescription') and no incoming dependencies. Although the dependent classes themselves have many dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing), which is required to qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
