{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.JavaModule",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaModule' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 12 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'JavaModule' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
