{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes CachedReturnPlugin, ByteCodeElement, TypeDescription, and AnnotationList. While some of these dependency classes themselves have many dependencies (e.g., TypeDescription has 64 dependencies), this does not indicate that FieldDescription.Token itself has hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, either incoming or outgoing. With only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, this class does not meet the criteria for hub-like modularization."
