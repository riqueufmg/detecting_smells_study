    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.ForLoadedMethods",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to utility classes (ConstructorComparator, MethodComparator) and one core class (MethodDescription), which is expected given its role as a method list abstraction. The number of dependencies is not excessive for its functionality, and there's no indication of it being a central hub with numerous bidirectional relationships."
