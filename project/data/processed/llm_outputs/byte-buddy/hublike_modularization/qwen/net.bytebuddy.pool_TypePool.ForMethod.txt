    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ForMethod' has incoming dependencies from 1 class (TypePool with 51 dependencies) and outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (MethodDescription with 21 dependencies and TypeList with 11 dependencies). The total number of dependencies (incoming + outgoing) is 51 + 21 + 11 = 83, which indicates a high number of dependencies and qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
