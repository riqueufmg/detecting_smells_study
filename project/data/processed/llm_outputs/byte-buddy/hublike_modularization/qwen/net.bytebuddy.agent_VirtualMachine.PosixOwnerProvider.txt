    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.PosixOwnerProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from VirtualMachine class. The incoming dependency shows that VirtualMachine depends on multiple classes including this one, but this class itself does not exhibit hub-like behavior with numerous dependencies. It appears to be a simple provider class with minimal coupling."
