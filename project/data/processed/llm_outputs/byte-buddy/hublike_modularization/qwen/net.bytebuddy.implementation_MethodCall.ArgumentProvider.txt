{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ArgumentProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to FieldDescription and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While FieldDescription itself has multiple dependencies, the MethodCall.ArgumentProvider class only directly depends on these two abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
