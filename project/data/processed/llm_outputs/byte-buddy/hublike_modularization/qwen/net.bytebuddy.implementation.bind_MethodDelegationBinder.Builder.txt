    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies and the relatively low number of direct outgoing dependencies do not indicate hub-like modularization."
