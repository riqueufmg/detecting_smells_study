    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.FilePrefixMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ElementMatcher, ClassFileLocator, and Plugin, each of which have multiple dependencies themselves, but the FilePrefixMatcher class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions directly."
