    "justification": "The class 'MethodDescription.TypeToken' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypeDescription' and 'CachedReturnPlugin', and the incoming dependency is from 'MethodDescription'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
