    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDescription.OfTypeVariable' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TypeDescription'), which itself has a large number of outgoing dependencies. This pattern indicates that 'TypeDescription.OfTypeVariable' acts as a hub connecting to many other abstractions both directly and indirectly through 'TypeDescription'."
