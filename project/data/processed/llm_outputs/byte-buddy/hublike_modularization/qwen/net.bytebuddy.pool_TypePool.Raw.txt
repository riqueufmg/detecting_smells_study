    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Raw",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Raw' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include 'RecordComponentDescription', 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', 'TypeList', and 'TypePool', each of which has a substantial number of further dependencies. For example, 'TypeDescription' has 60+ dependencies, 'MethodDescription' has 20+, and 'TypePool' itself has 70+ dependencies. This indicates that 'TypePool.Raw' acts as a hub connecting to many other abstractions both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
