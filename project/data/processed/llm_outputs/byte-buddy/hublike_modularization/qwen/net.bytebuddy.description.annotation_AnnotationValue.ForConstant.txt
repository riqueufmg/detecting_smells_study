    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.ForConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationValue.ForConstant' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes: 'AnnotationValue', 'MethodDescription', 'TypeDescription', and 'CachedReturnPlugin'. However, it has no incoming dependencies from other classes. While it depends on multiple abstractions, the lack of incoming dependencies means it does not act as a hub that other abstractions depend on. Hub-like Modularization requires both significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not met here."
