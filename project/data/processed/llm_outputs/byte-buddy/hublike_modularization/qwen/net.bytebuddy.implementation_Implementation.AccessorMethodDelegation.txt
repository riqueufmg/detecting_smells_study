{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.AccessorMethodDelegation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, MethodDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and Implementation. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies, the class itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor is it depended upon by others, which would be indicative of hub-like modularization."
