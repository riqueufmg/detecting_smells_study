{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.WithInstance",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4 unique classes) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to core infrastructure classes (TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, TypeDescription, MethodGraph, FieldDescription) which is typical for a delegation-based implementation. While some of these dependencies have extensive internal structures, the WithInstance class itself only directly depends on a small number of abstractions, not exhibiting hub-like characteristics."
