{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.RecordComponentAttributeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (AnnotationValueFilter, AnnotationAppender, RecordComponentDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and incoming dependencies from 14 other abstractions across multiple packages (DynamicType and its inner classes, TypeWriter and its variants, RecordComponentRegistry and its variants, and Factory/Compound classes). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
