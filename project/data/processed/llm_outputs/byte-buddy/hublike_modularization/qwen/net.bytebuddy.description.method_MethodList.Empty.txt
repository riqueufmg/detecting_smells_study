    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList.Empty' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'MethodDescription', 'FilterableList', and 'ByteCodeElement'. While 'MethodDescription' itself has many dependencies, the 'MethodList.Empty' class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The class does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction, therefore it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
