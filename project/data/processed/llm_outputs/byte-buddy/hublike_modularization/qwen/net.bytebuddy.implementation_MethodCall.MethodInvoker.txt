    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. The incoming dependencies are from MethodCall. The number of dependencies is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a large number of interactions with other abstractions."
