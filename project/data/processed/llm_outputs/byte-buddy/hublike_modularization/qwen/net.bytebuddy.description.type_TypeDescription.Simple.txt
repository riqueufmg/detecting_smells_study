    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class 'TypeDescription', which itself has numerous dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor is it a central dependency for many other classes based on the provided data."
