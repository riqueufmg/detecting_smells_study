{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation' has outgoing dependencies to 34 other classes and incoming dependencies from 144 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class is a central point of interaction within the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The class interacts with numerous other abstractions both by depending on them and by being depended upon, making it a hub in the modular structure."
