    "justification": "The class 'DoubleConstant' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies) and only 1 incoming dependency from 'DefaultValue'. The dependencies are focused within the bytecode and implementation packages, and the class does not exhibit a hub-like pattern with excessive incoming or outgoing connections."
