{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member.MethodInvocation.HandleInvocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, MethodDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and Implementation. While some of these dependencies have extensive dependency lists themselves, the analyzed class does not show a pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly. The lack of incoming dependencies and the limited number of outgoing dependencies indicate that this class is not acting as a hub within the system."
