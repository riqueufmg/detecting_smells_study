    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.FieldManifestation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldManifestation' has only one outgoing dependency to 'ModifierContributor' and is referenced by 14 other classes. However, the number of incoming dependencies (14) does not indicate a large number in the context of software systems, and the outgoing dependency is minimal. Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not the case here."
