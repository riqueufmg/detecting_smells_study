{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.LazyFacade",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypePool, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeDescription, and CachedReturnPlugin. While TypePool itself has many dependencies (65), this does not indicate that LazyFacade is hub-like since LazyFacade only directly depends on 4 abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
