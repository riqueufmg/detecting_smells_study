{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.RenderingDispatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency is from its outer class 'AnnotationValue' which is expected for inner classes. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ClassFileVersion' and 'ClassFileLocator', which are core utilities. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization as it does not show excessive or widespread dependencies to a large number of abstractions."
