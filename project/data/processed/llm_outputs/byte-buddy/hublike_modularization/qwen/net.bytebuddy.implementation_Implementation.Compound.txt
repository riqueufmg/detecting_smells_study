    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Compound' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and is involved in 1 incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
