{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender.Explicit",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AnnotationAppender and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While AnnotationAppender itself has many dependencies (8), this does not make TypeAttributeAppender.Explicit a hub since it directly depends on only 2 classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
