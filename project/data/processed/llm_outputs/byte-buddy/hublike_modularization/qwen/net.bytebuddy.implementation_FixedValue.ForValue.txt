    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FixedValue.ForValue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'FixedValue.ForValue' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive outgoing and incoming dependencies. It directly depends on 5 external classes, and through its outgoing dependencies, it connects to a large number of other abstractions (e.g., 'TypeDescription' connects to 60+ classes, 'StackManipulation' connects to 5+ classes, etc.). Additionally, it is depended upon by 'FixedValue', which itself connects to 15+ classes. This creates a central hub with numerous bidirectional relationships, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
