    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.HashCodeMethod.NoOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency shows that HashCodeMethod depends on this class, but this does not indicate a hub-like pattern. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
