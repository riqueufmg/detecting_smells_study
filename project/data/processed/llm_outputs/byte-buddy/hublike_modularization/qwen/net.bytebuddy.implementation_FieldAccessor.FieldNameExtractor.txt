```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.FieldNameExtractor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency shows FieldAccessor depends on this class along with many others, but the FieldNameExtractor itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Hub-like Modularization requires the analyzed class to have many dependencies both incoming and outgoing, which is not the case here."
