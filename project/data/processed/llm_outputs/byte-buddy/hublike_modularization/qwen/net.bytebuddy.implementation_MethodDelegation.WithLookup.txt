{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.WithLookup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes, and some of these dependencies themselves have a large number of further outgoing dependencies (e.g., TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder with 16 dependencies and MethodGraph with 24 dependencies). This indicates that the class interacts with multiple abstractions indirectly through its dependencies, contributing to hub-like modularization."
