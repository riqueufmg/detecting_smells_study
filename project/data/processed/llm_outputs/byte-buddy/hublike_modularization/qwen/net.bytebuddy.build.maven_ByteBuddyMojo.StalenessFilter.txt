    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ByteBuddyMojo.StalenessFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher and Plugin) and 1 incoming dependency (ByteBuddyMojo). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
