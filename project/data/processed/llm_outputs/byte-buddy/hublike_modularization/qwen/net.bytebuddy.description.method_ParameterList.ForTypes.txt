    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.method.ParameterList.ForTypes' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'ParameterList', 'MethodDescription', and 'ParameterDescription', each of which has a moderate number of further dependencies, but this does not indicate that 'ForTypes' itself has a large number of direct dependencies or is a hub. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization based on the provided data."
