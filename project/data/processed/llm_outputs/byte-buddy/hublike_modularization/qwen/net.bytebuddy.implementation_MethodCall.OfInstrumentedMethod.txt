    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.OfInstrumentedMethod' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of dependencies. It has 34 outgoing dependencies to various classes and interfaces within the same package and related packages, indicating it interacts with a wide range of abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the 'MethodCall' class which itself has 49 dependencies, suggesting that 'OfInstrumentedMethod' is a central point of interaction. The large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of hub-like modularization."
