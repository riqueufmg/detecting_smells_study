    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement.Token' has only 2 outgoing dependencies ('net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
