    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 21 other classes and outgoing dependencies to at least 1 class (Installer). The high number of incoming dependencies (21) indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, which is a strong indicator of Hub-like Modularization."
