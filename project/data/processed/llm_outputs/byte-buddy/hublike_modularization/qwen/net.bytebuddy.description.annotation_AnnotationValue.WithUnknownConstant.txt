    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.WithUnknownConstant",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationValue.WithUnknownConstant' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'AnnotationValue', 'MethodDescription', and 'TypeDescription'. While these dependent classes themselves have many dependencies, the class in question does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) which would indicate Hub-like Modularization. The metric of having few direct connections does not meet the criteria for this smell."
