{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.attribute.TypeAttributeAppender",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeAttributeAppender' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 11 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
