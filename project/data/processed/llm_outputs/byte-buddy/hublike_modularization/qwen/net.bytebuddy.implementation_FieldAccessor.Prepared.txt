    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.Prepared",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.FieldLocator' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. The incoming dependency is from 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor'. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
