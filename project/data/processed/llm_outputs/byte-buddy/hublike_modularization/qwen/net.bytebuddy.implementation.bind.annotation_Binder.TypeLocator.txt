    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.TypeLocator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.TypeLocator' has outgoing dependencies to 64 classes/interfaces within the 'TypeDescription' hierarchy and incoming dependencies from the 'Binder' class which itself has dependencies to 44 other classes/interfaces. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting numerous abstractions."
