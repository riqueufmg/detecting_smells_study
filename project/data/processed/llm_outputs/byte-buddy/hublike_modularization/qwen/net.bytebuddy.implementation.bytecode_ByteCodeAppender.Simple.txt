    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.ByteCodeAppender.Simple",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While the Implementation class has many dependencies (26), this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself, as we only consider the class in isolation. The class does not show a pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
