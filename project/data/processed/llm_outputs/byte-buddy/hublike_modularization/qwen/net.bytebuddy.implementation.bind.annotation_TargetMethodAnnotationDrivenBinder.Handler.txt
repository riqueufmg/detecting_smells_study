    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.Handler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include core implementation classes such as 'Implementation', 'Binder', 'BindingMechanic', 'Assigner', 'AnnotationDescription', and 'ParameterDescription', indicating a central role in coordinating interactions between multiple abstractions. The presence of both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms hub-like modularization."
