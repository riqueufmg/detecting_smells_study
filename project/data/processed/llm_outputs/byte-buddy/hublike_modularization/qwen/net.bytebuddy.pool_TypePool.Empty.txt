    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Empty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.Empty' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which itself has a large number of dependencies. However, since the analysis must consider the class in isolation and the class itself does not exhibit hub-like characteristics (no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency), it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
