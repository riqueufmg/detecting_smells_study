    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (MethodDescription and TypeDescription), and no incoming dependencies. Although the dependent classes themselves have many dependencies, the ConstructorResolver class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies."
