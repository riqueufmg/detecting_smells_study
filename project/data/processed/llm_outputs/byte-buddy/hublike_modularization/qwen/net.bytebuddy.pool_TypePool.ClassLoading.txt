{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ClassLoading",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ClassLoadingStrategy, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the TypePool.ClassLoading class only directly depends on these 3 abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
