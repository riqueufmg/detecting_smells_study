    "justification": "The class 'IntegerConstant' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3 direct dependencies) and only one incoming dependency from 'DefaultValue'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, especially considering the context of the provided data where other classes like 'Implementation' show significantly more dependencies."
