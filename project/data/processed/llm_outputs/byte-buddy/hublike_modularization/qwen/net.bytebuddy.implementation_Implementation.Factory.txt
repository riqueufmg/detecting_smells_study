{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.Factory' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'AuxiliaryType', 'ClassFileVersion', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', and 'MethodGraph'. While some of these dependencies themselves have further dependencies, the 'Implementation.Factory' class in isolation does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies, nor does it act as a hub with many incoming and outgoing connections. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
