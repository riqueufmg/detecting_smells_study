    "justification": "The class 'FieldDescription' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (138). It interacts with numerous other abstractions across different packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription', 'net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin', 'net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable', and many others. This extensive web of dependencies indicates that 'FieldDescription' acts as a hub within the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
