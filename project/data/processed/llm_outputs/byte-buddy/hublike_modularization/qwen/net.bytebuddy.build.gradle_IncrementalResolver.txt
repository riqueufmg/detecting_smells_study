    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.gradle.work.ChangeType) and 2 incoming dependencies (ByteBuddyTaskExtension and ByteBuddyTask). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
