    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeList.AttachedTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeVariableToken, TypeVariableSource, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription itself has many dependencies, the AttachedTypeVariable class does not directly depend on those downstream dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
