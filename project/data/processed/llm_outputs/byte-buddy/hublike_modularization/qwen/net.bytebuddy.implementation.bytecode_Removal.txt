    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Removal",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Removal' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'TypeDefinition', 'Implementation', 'StackSize', and 'StackManipulation'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 20 other abstractions across multiple packages such as 'net.bytebuddy.dynamic' and 'net.bytebuddy.asm'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Removal' acts as a hub connecting numerous abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
