{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.ExtractableView",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Implementation.ExtractableView' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes: 'AnnotationValueFilter', 'ClassFileVersion', 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', 'TypeDescription', and 'TypeInitializer'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the class 'Implementation', which itself depends on 25 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Implementation.ExtractableView' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
