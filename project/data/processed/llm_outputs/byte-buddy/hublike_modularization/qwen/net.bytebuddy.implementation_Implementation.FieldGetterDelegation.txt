{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.FieldGetterDelegation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, MethodDescription, FieldDescription, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While some of these dependencies have further dependencies, the FieldGetterDelegation class itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies, thus not meeting the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
