    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.SyntheticState",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.SyntheticState' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'net.bytebuddy.build.CachedReturnPlugin', 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.AuxiliaryType', and 'net.bytebuddy.description.ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase'. It also has outgoing dependencies to 'net.bytebuddy.description.modifier.ModifierContributor' and its sub-classes. This indicates that the class is involved in numerous dependency relationships both in terms of being depended upon and depending on other abstractions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
