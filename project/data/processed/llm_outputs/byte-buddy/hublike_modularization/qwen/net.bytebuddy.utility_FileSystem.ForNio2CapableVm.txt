    "class": "net.bytebuddy.utility.FileSystem.ForNio2CapableVm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to JavaDispatcher and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While JavaDispatcher itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class ForNio2CapableVm only directly depends on these two abstractions, which is not a large number. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
