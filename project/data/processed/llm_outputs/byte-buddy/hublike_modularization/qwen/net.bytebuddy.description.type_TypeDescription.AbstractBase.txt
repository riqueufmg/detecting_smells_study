    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AbstractBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.AbstractBase' has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'). The class interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, which is indicative of Hub-like Modularization. Specifically, its outgoing dependencies include core framework classes such as 'TypeDescription', 'MethodDescription', 'FieldDescription', 'AnnotationList', 'JavaType', and several plugin and utility classes, showing a central role in the module's structure."
