    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool', which itself has many dependencies. The class in analysis does not exhibit hub-like modularization since it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have dependencies from a large number of other abstractions beyond a single incoming dependency."
