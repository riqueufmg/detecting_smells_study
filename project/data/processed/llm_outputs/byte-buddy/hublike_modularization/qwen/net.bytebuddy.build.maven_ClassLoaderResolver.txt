    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.maven.ClassLoaderResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to MavenCoordinate) and 2 incoming dependencies (from ByteBuddyMojo and Initialization). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
