    "class": "net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ModuleToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.pool.TypePool.ModuleToken' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of outgoing dependencies (2 classes) and incoming dependencies (1 class with 55 dependencies). The class depends directly on 'ModuleDescription' and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin', while being depended upon by 'TypePool' which has a large list of dependencies including it. This central role in dependencies indicates hub-like behavior."
