    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.method.MethodList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodList' has outgoing dependencies on 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 34 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MethodList' acts as a hub connecting numerous other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
