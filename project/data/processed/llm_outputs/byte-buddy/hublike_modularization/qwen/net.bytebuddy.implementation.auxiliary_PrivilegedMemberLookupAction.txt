    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary.PrivilegedMemberLookupAction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'PrivilegedMemberLookupAction' has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes, but no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple abstractions, it does not exhibit hub-like behavior since it is not depended upon by other classes. Hub-like modularization requires both significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not the case here."
