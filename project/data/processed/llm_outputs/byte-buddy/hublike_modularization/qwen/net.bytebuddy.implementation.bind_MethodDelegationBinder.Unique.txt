    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodDelegationBinder.Unique",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, Implementation, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. While the Implementation class itself has many dependencies, the MethodDelegationBinder.Unique class only directly depends on a small number of abstractions, which does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
