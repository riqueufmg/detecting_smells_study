```json
{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.ByteCodeElement.TokenList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.matcher.FilterableList' and 'net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription'. While 'TypeDescription' itself has many dependencies, the 'TokenList' class only directly depends on these two abstractions. This does not constitute a hub-like modularization smell as the class is not interacting with a large number of other abstractions directly."
