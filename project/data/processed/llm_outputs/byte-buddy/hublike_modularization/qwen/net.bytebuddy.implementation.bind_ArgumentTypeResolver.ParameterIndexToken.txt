    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ArgumentTypeResolver.ParameterIndexToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class ArgumentTypeResolver. The incoming dependency shows the enclosing class uses this static nested class, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
