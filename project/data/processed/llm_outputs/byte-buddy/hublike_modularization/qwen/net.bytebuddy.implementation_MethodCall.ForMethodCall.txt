    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForMethodCall' has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall'), which itself has a very large number of outgoing dependencies (35). This indicates that 'ForMethodCall' is centrally involved in interactions with numerous abstractions, both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
