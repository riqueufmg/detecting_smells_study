    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and incoming dependencies (1). It does not exhibit a high number of dependencies relative to the CONTEXT_SIZE=2020 threshold, nor does it act as a central hub connecting a large number of abstractions. Therefore, it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
