        "The class has incoming dependencies from 1 other class, showing that it is being used as a dependency.",
        "The outgoing dependencies include core infrastructure classes such as TypeDescription, MethodDescription, StackManipulation, and Assigner, which are likely to be widely used across the system.",
        "The presence of dependencies on multiple abstraction layers (type description, method description, bytecode manipulation) suggests that this class interacts with various parts of the system, contributing to hub-like modularization."
