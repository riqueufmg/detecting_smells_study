    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.ExceptionMethod.ForStringConstructor' has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
