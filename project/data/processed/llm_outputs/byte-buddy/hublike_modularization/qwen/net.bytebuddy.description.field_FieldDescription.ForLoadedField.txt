    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.field.FieldDescription.ForLoadedField",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldDescription.ForLoadedField' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'AnnotationList', 'TypeDescription', and 'CachedReturnPlugin'. While 'TypeDescription' itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate that 'FieldDescription.ForLoadedField' has direct dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of dependencies nor is it a central point of dependency for many other classes."
