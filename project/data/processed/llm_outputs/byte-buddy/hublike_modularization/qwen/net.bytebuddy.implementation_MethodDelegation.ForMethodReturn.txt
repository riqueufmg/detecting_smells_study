    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation.ForMethodReturn",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodDelegation.ForMethodReturn' has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct classes across different packages, including 'MethodDelegationBinder', 'TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder', 'MethodDescription', 'MethodList', 'MethodGraph', 'StackManipulation', and 'ElementMatcher'. This indicates a high number of outgoing dependencies to various abstractions. Additionally, the class has no incoming dependencies, but the extensive outgoing connections suggest it acts as a hub interacting with numerous other components, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
