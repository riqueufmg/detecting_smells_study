    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor.ForImplicitProperty",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldAccessor.ForImplicitProperty' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes: MethodReturn, TypeDescription, ConstantValue, Implementation, StackManipulation, FieldDescription, Assigner, FieldLocator, and HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions."
