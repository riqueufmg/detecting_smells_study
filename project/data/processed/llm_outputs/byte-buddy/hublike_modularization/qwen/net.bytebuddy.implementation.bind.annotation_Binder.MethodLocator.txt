    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.MethodLocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.MethodLocator' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Implementation' and 'TypeDescription', which are central abstractions, but the class itself does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies. The incoming dependency is solely from 'Binder', indicating it is used within that context. There is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
