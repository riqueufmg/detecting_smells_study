    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.EqualsMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'EqualsMethod' has outgoing dependencies to 19 other classes across multiple packages. It also declares several inner classes (e.g., 'UsingJump', 'TypePropertyComparator', 'SuperClassCheck', etc.) that contribute to its high number of dependencies. The large number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
