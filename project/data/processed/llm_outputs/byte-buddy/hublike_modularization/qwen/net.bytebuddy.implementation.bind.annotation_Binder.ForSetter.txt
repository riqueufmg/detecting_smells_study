    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Binder.ForSetter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Binder.ForSetter' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('MethodDescription', 'DynamicType', and 'HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'), and each of these classes has a large number of their own dependencies (20+). This creates a hub-like structure where 'Binder.ForSetter' connects to many abstractions indirectly through its direct dependencies, resulting in Hub-like Modularization."
