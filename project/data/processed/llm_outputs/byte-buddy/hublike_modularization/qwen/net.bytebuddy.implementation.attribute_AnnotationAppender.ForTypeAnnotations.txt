    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and no incoming dependencies. The dependencies are focused on related abstractions within the same package and a few core types from other packages. This does not indicate a hub-like structure where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of diverse abstractions."
