    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only incoming dependencies from 7 test classes within the same package. While it is referenced by multiple classes, it does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions nor does it have a high number of outgoing dependencies. The dependencies are limited to intra-package references and the class itself has no dependencies."
