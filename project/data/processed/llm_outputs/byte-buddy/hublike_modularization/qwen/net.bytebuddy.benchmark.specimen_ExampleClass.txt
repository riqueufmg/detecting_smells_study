    "class": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen.ExampleClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only incoming dependencies from two other classes (ClassByExtensionBenchmark and SuperClassInvocationBenchmark) and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies show that only 2 other abstractions depend on this class, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies indicative of hub-like modularization. There are no outgoing dependencies to other abstractions. The total dependency count (2 incoming, 0 outgoing) is not large enough to qualify as hub-like modularization."
