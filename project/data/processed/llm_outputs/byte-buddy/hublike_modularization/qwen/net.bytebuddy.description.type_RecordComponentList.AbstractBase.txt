{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.RecordComponentList.AbstractBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to RecordComponentDescription, TypeDescription, FilterableList, ByteCodeElement, and TypeList. While some of these dependencies have extensive dependencies themselves, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies further indicates it is not a hub-like module."
