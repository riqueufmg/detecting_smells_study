    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.description.annotation.AnnotationValue.Loaded' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'TypeDescription', 'AnnotationValue', and 'CachedReturnPlugin'. The incoming dependencies come only from 'AnnotationValue'. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not connect to a large number of other abstractions either in incoming or outgoing directions."
