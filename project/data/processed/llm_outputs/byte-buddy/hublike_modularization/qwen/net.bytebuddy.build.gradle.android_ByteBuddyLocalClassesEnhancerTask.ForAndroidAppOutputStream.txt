    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only one outgoing dependency to 'net.bytebuddy.build.Plugin', which itself has many dependencies. However, the analyzed class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it act as a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections."
