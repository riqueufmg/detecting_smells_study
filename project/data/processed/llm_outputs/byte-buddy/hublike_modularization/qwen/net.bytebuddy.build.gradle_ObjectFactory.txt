    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.ObjectFactory' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('ObjectFactory.ForLegacyGradle' and 'ObjectFactory.Dispatcher') and incoming dependencies from 2 classes ('AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension' and 'AbstractByteBuddyTask'), with a total of 7 and 9 dependencies respectively. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
