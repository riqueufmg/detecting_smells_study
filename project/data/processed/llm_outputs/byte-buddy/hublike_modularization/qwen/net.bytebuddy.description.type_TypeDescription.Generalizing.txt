    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to TypeDescription) and no incoming dependencies. The large number of dependencies listed are from the dependent TypeDescription class, not from the Generalizing class itself. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have many direct dependencies, which is not the case here."
