{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.VirtualMachine.SolarisLibrary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class VirtualMachine, which is expected for inner classes. The incoming dependencies list shows VirtualMachine depending on multiple classes including SolarisLibrary, but this represents the enclosing class relationship rather than hub-like modularization where the analyzed class itself would have many dependencies."
