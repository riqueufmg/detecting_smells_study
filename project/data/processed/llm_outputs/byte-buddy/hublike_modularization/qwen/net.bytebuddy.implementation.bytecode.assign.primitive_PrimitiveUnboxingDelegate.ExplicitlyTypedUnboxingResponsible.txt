    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency, which is not a large number of dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, both incoming and outgoing. The provided data shows a relatively small number of dependencies, so this smell is not detected."
