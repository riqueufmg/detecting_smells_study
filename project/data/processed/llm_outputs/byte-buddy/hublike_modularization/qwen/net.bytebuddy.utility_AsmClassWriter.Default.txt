    "justification": "The class 'net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter.Default' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and only one incoming dependency from 'net.bytebuddy.utility.AsmClassWriter'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to various parts of the system. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
