    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.InvocationHandlerAdapter.Appender",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StackManipulation, FieldDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, and TypeDescription. While TypeDescription has many dependencies itself, the analyzed class does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
