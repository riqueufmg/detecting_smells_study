    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation' and 'net.bytebuddy.build.HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin'. While the first dependency has many further dependencies, the class itself does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies."
