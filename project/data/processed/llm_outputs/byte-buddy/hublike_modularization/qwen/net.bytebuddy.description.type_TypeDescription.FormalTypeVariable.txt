    "class": "net.bytebuddy.description.type.TypeDescription.FormalTypeVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (JavaDispatcher) and one incoming dependency (TypeDescription). The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
