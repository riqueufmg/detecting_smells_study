    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (only 3 direct dependencies) and only one incoming dependency from a single class (Binder). The dependencies it interacts with are not numerous enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing."
