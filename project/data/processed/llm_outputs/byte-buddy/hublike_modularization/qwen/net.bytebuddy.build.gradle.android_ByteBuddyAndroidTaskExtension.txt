{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.gradle.android.ByteBuddyAndroidTaskExtension",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (Transformation, EntryPoint, Discovery, ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask) and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions (ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask, ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask.ConfigurationAction). The class also appears in the dependencies of EntryPoint which has 10 additional dependencies, and is involved in a circular dependency with ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask. This creates a hub-like structure where this class is central to multiple dependency relationships both incoming and outgoing."
