    "justification": "The class 'Openness' has only one outgoing dependency to 'ModifierContributor' and is listed among dependencies of two incoming dependency sources ('ModifierReviewable' and 'ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase'). The number of dependencies is not excessively high in either direction, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections beyond what is typical for a modifier class in this context."
