    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 12 other abstractions (Ownership, ConstructorStrategy, TypeDescription, DynamicType, Advice, Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ClassFileVersion, Implementation, TypeValidation, AnnotationDescription, CachedReturnPlugin). This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, coupling to many different parts of the system."
