    "justification": "The class has a high number of outgoing dependencies (20 distinct classes). It also has incoming dependencies from 0 classes, but the definition focuses on both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The outgoing count of 20 is considered large, indicating hub-like coupling."
