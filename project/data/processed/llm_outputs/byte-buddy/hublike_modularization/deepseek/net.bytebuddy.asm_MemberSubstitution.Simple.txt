    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 11 distinct abstractions (StackManipulation, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Assigner, FieldDescription, TypeDefinition, AnnotationDescription, JavaConstant, ConstantValue). This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, coupling to many other abstractions."
