    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.RenamingPlugin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 15 distinct abstractions (MethodList, TypePool, OpenedClassReader, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, DynamicType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, Plugin, AsmVisitorWrapper, Implementation, RenamingPlugin.Renaming, FieldList, ElementMatchers). This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a hub, coupling with many other abstractions."
