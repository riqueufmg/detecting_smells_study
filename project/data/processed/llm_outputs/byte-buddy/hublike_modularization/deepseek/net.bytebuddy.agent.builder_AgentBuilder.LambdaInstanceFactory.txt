{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.LambdaInstanceFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 18 different abstractions (Visibility, Ownership, MethodManifestation, ByteCodeAppender, ConstructorStrategy, StackManipulation, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, DynamicType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeManifestation, ByteBuddy, FieldManifestation, FieldDescription, Assigner, MethodReturn, Duplication, JavaConstant), which constitutes a large number of outgoing dependencies. This meets the definition of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
