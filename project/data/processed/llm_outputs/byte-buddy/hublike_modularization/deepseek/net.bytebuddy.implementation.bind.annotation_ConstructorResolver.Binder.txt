{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.ConstructorResolver.Binder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions (TypeDescription, MethodDescription, Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, Implementation, MethodDelegationBinder, AnnotationDescription). This large number of outgoing dependencies, combined with the provided dependency lists showing these abstractions themselves have extensive internal dependencies, indicates the class acts as a central hub connecting to many other parts of the system."
