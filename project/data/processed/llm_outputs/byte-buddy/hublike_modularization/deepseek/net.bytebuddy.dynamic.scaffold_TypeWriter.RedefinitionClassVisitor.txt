    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions (TypeInitializer, MethodRebaseResolver, OpenedClassReader, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, ClassFileVersion, Implementation, ModifierContributor). This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, connecting to many other parts of the system."
