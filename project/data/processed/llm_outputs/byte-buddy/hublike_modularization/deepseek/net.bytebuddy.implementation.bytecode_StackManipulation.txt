    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies and 125 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 130 dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates a hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central connector."
