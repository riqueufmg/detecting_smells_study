    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 outgoing dependencies and 6 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 24 distinct dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates the class acts as a central hub, coupling with a large number of other abstractions."
