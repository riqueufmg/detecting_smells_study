    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.Implementation.Default",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 19 other abstractions (TypeInitializer, ByteCodeAppender, ParameterList, TypeDescription, FieldDescription, Visibility, AnnotationValueFilter, TypeWriter, AnnotationList, MethodDescription, AnnotationValue, AuxiliaryType, StackManipulation, MethodReturn, Implementation, ParameterDescription, TypeList, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, ClassFileVersion). This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a hub, coupling with many other components."
