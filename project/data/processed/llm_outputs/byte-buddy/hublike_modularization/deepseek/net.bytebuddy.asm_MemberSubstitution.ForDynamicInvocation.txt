    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.MemberSubstitution.ForDynamicInvocation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies include large, complex classes (e.g., TypeDescription with 66 dependencies, MethodDescription with 26 dependencies, JavaConstant with 28 dependencies). The incoming dependency is from a large, central class (MemberSubstitution with 78 dependencies). This high number of connections to major abstractions indicates the class acts as a hub."
