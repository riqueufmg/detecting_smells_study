    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 13 other abstractions (StreamDrainer, TypePool, MethodNameTransformer, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, DynamicType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, TypeResolutionStrategy, ByteBuddy, ClassFileVersion, ElementMatcher, Plugin, EntryPoint). This large number of outgoing dependencies qualifies it as a hub-like modularization smell."
