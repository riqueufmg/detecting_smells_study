    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are large abstractions (e.g., TypeDescription with 70+ internal dependencies, MethodDescription with 25+ internal dependencies, Implementation with 30+ internal dependencies). The incoming dependency is from Advice, which is a large abstraction with 100+ internal dependencies. The class acts as a hub connecting multiple major abstractions."
