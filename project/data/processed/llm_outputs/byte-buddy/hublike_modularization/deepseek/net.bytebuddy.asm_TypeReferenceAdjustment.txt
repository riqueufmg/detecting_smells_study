    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 11 distinct abstractions (MethodList, TypePool, OpenedClassReader, TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, FieldDescription, ElementMatcher, AsmVisitorWrapper, Implementation, FieldList, ElementMatchers). This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, coupling many different parts of the system."
