    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct abstractions (LatentMatcher, ClassFileLocator, TypeDescription, Assigner, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Advice, DynamicType, AsmVisitorWrapper, LoadedTypeInitializer). The outgoing dependency 'TypeDescription' itself has a large number of internal dependencies (over 70), indicating it is a highly connected hub. The cumulative connectivity through these outgoing dependencies is substantial, meeting the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
