    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 12 other abstractions (e.g., VirtualMachine.Connection, VirtualMachine.SolarisLibrary) and incoming dependencies from 3 other abstractions (ByteBuddyAgent, ByteBuddyAgent.AttachmentProvider, ByteBuddyAgent.ForEmulatedAttachment). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
