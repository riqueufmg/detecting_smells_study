    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct abstractions (StackManipulation, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, Assigner, NullConstant, TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder, Implementation, MethodDelegationBinder, AnnotationDescription), which is a large number of outgoing dependencies. It also has 0 incoming dependencies, but the definition focuses on both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the high outgoing count qualifies as a large number of dependencies."
