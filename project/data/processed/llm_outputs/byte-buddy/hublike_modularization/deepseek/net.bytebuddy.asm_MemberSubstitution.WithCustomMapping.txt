    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 12 distinct abstractions (EnumerationDescription, ParameterDescription, TypeDescription, MethodDescription, TypeList, FieldDescription, MethodGraph, JavaType, TypeDefinition, AnnotationValue, JavaConstant, ConstantValue). This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, coupling to a large portion of the system's abstractions."
