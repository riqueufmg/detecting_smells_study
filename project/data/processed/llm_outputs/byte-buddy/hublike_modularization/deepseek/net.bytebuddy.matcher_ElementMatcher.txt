    "class": "net.bytebuddy.matcher.ElementMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 2 outgoing dependencies and 94 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 96 dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates a hub-like structure where the abstraction serves as a central connection point for many other components."
