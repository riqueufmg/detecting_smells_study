    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 28 distinct abstractions (TypePool, TypeDescription, InliningImplementationMatcher, InstrumentedType, AsmVisitorWrapper, MethodRebaseResolver, AnnotationValueFilter, TypeWriter, TypeAttributeAppender, ClassFileLocator, MethodDescription, MethodRegistry, FieldRegistry, ElementMatchers, RecordComponentRegistry, LatentMatcher, AuxiliaryType, MethodNameTransformer, DynamicType, AsmClassWriter, MethodGraph, Implementation, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, AnnotationRetention, ClassFileVersion, AsmClassReader, VisibilityBridgeStrategy, TypeValidation). This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a hub, coupling with many other abstractions in the system."
