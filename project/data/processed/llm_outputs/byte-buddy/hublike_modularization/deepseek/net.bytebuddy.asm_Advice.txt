    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of dependencies: 124 outgoing dependencies (listed in the 'dependencies' array) and 10 incoming dependencies (from classes like AgentBuilder, CachedReturnPlugin, and Advice.Appender). This high count of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub, coupling with many other abstractions."
