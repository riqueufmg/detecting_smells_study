    "justification": "The class has a large number of incoming dependencies (30 classes) from various packages and components, including ClassInjector, DynamicType, MethodRegistry, TypeWriter, AgentBuilder, ByteBuddy, and multiple plugin and builder classes. This high fan-in indicates it acts as a central hub that many other abstractions depend on."
