    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 16 other abstractions (Visibility, Ownership, MethodManifestation, RequiredPhase, ProvisioningState, Openness, SynchronizationState, TypeManifestation, FieldManifestation, MethodStrictness, ParameterManifestation, Transitivity, FieldPersistence, EnumerationState, Mandate, SyntheticState). This large number of outgoing dependencies qualifies as hub-like modularization."
