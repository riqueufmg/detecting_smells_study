{
    "class": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.TypeWriter.WithDecorationOnly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 15 distinct abstractions (AnnotationValueFilter, AuxiliaryType, TypeInitializer, RecordComponentList, OpenedClassReader, TypeDescription, FieldList, AsmClassWriter, FieldDescription, ClassFileVersion, AsmClassReader, Implementation, MethodList, RecordComponentDescription, LoadedTypeInitializer). This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, coupling to many other parts of the system."
