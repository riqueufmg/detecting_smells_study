    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (ModifierContributor) and is referenced by three incoming dependencies (CachedReturnPlugin, ModifierReviewable, ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase). The total number of distinct dependency connections is low, not indicating a hub-like structure with a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
