    "class": "net.bytebuddy.build.EntryPoint",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 10 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 25 distinct dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates the class acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions between many other abstractions."
