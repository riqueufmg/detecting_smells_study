    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies (AuxiliaryType, TypeDescription, ClassFileLocator, DynamicType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, NexusAccessor, ClassInjector) and 1 incoming dependency (AgentBuilder). The number of outgoing dependencies is large, indicating the class acts as a hub with many outgoing connections to diverse abstractions."
