    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (SafeVarargsPlugin, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 1 incoming dependency (AgentBuilder). This low number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
