    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder.RawMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ElementMatcher, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 1 incoming dependency (AgentBuilder). This low number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
