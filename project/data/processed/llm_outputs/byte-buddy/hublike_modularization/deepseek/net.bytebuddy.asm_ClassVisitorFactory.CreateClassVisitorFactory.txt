    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 10 other abstractions (MethodCall, ConstructorStrategy, MethodDescription, DynamicType, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin, Assigner, ByteBuddy, MultipleParentClassLoader, MethodReturn, Implementation). This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a hub, coupling to a large portion of the system."
