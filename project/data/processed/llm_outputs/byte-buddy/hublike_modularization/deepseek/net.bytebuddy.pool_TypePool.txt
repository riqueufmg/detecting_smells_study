    "justification": "The class has a large number of dependencies: 62 outgoing dependencies (listed in 'dependencies' array) and 45 incoming dependencies (listed in 'incoming_dependencies' array). This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates the class acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions between many other abstractions."
