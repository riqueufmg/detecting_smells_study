    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (TypeDescription, HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin) and 1 incoming dependency (TypeProxy). This low number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
