    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (to HashCodeAndEqualsPlugin). It has incoming dependencies from 10 other classes, but the definition requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are minimal, not indicating hub-like coupling."
