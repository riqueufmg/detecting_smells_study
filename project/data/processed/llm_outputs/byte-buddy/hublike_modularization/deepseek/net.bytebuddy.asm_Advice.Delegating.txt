    "class": "net.bytebuddy.asm.Advice.Delegating",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies include large, central abstractions like TypeDescription (with 58 internal dependencies), MethodDescription (with 26 internal dependencies), and Implementation (with 31 internal dependencies). This high number of connections to major system abstractions indicates the class acts as a hub."
