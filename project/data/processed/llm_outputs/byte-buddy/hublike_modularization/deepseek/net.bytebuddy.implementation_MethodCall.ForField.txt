    "class": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodCall.ForField",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency is from a large hub class (MethodCall with 58 dependencies), and the outgoing dependencies are to diverse abstractions across multiple packages. The total number of distinct dependency connections is high, indicating hub-like coupling."
