    "class": "net.bytebuddy.agent.builder.AgentBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of dependencies: 124 outgoing dependencies (listed in the 'dependencies' array) and 19 incoming dependencies (from classes like ResettableClassFileTransformer, AgentBuilder.Default, AgentBuilder.Listener, etc.). This high count of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub, coupling with many other abstractions."
