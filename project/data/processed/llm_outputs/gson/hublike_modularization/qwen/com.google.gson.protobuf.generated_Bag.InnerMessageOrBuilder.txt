    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.InnerMessageOrBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag and no incoming dependencies. The dependency metrics show low coupling, which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
