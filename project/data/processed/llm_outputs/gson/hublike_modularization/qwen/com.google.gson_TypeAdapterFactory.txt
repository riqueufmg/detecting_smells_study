    "class": "com.google.gson.TypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.TypeAdapterFactory' has incoming dependencies from 14 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes, creating a total of 17 dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
