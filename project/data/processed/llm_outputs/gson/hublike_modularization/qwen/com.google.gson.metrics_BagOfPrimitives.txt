    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitives",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies from benchmark classes. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
