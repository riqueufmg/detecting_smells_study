{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper.RecordHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ReflectionHelper. The incoming dependency shows that ReflectionHelper depends on this class along with three other classes (GsonBuildConfig, TroubleshootingGuide, JsonIOException), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
