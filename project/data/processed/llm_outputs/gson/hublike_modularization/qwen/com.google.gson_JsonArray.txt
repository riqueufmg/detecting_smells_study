{
    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JsonArray has only 2 outgoing dependencies (JsonElement and JsonNull) and appears in the dependencies of 6 other classes. Given the limited number of outgoing dependencies and the fact that it is not depending on a large number of abstractions nor being depended upon by an excessive number of abstractions, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
