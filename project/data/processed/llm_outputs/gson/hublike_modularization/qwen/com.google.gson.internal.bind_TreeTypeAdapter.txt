{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TreeTypeAdapter' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'TypeToken', 'TypeAdapter', 'JsonReader', 'JsonElement', 'Streams', 'TypeAdapterFactory', 'Gson', 'JsonDeserializer', 'JsonSerializer', and 'JsonWriter'. The incoming dependencies originate from 'GsonBuilder' and 'JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory', indicating that this class is widely used and connected within the system. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
