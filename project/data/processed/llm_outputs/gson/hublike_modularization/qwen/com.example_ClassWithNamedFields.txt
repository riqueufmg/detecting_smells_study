    "class": "com.example.ClassWithNamedFields",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from class com.example.Main. The incoming dependency list shows Main depends on 13 classes including this one, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for this specific class since it has minimal dependencies itself."
