    "class": "com.google.gson.interceptors.JsonPostDeserializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from InterceptorFactory and InterceptorFactory.InterceptorAdapter, and no outgoing dependencies. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
