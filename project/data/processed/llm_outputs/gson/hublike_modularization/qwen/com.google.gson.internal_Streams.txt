    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Streams",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.internal.Streams' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting multiple abstractions within the system. This central role in managing dependencies aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
