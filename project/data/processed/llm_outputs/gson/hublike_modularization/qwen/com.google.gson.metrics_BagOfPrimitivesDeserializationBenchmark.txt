    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitivesDeserializationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes BagOfPrimitives, JsonReader, NonUploadingCaliperRunner, and Gson. While Gson itself has many dependencies, the BagOfPrimitivesDeserializationBenchmark class only directly depends on these 4 abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization given the context size of 766."
