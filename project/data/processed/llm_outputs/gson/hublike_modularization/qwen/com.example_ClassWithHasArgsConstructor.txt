    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from com.example.Main, which depends on 12 different classes including this one. While Main class shows hub-like behavior by depending on many classes, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependencies."
