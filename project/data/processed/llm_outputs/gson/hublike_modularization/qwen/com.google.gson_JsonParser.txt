    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JsonParser has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that JsonParser interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
