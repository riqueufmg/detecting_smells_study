{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ConstructorConstructor' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions between multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
