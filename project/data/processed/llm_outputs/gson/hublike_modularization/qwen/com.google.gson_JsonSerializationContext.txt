    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (JsonElement) and 2 incoming dependencies (JsonSerializer and ProtoTypeAdapter). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show a large number of connections with other abstractions."
