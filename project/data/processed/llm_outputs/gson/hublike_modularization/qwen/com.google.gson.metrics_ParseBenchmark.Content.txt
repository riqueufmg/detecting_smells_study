    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.Content",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ParseBenchmark class. The incoming dependencies show that ParseBenchmark depends on multiple classes including ParseBenchmark.Content itself, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the Content class since it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
