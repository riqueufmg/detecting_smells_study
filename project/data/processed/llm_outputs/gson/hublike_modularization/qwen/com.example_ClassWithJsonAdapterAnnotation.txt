    "class": "com.example.ClassWithJsonAdapterAnnotation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to com.example.ClassWithJsonAdapterAnnotation.DummyClass and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
