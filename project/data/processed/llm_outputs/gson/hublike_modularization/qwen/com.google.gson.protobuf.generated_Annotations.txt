    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Annotations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Bag class. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
