```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.Strictness",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.Strictness' has incoming dependencies from 7 other classes: 'JsonParser', 'JsonStreamParser', 'JsonElement', 'Gson', 'GsonBuilder', 'JsonReader', and 'JsonWriter'. This indicates that a large number of abstractions depend on 'Strictness', which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
