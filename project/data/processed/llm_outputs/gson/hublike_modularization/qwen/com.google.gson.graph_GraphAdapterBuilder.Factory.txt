{
    "class": "com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (JsonToken) and 1 incoming dependency (GraphAdapterBuilder). The incoming dependency from GraphAdapterBuilder shows 9 dependencies but these represent the reverse direction of the relationship. For hub-like modularization, the class itself would need to have many direct dependencies, but it only has 1 outgoing dependency which is below the threshold for being considered hub-like."
