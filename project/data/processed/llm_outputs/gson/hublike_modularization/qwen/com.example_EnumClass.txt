{
    "class": "com.example.EnumClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Main class. The Main class has dependencies on 13 different classes/interfaces, but this does not indicate that EnumClass itself has hub-like modularization since it only appears as a dependency in one incoming relationship and has no outgoing dependencies."
