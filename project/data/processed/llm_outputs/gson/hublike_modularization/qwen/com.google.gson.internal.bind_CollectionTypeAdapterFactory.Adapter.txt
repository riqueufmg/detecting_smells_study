    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.CollectionTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are JsonToken, TypeAdapter, and ObjectConstructor. The incoming dependency is from CollectionTypeAdapterFactory. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
