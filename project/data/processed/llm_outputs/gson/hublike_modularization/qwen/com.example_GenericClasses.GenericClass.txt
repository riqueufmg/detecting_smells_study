{
    "class": "com.example.GenericClasses.GenericClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its own package's GenericClasses class. The number of dependencies is minimal, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
