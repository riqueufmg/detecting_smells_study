{
    "class": "com.example.GenericClasses",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies to inner classes (GenericClass and DummyClass) and no incoming dependencies from other classes. The low number of dependencies (2 outgoing, 0 incoming) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
