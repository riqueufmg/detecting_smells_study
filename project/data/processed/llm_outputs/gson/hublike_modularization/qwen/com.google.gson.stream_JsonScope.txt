{
    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.JsonScope",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JsonScope has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from JsonReader. The incoming dependency list shows JsonReader depends on 6 classes/interfaces, but this represents only one dependent class, not a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
