    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.PreJava9DateFormatProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from DefaultDateTypeAdapter. The incoming dependency shows DefaultDateTypeAdapter depends on this class, but this represents a single dependency relationship rather than dependencies with a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics as it has minimal dependency connections."
