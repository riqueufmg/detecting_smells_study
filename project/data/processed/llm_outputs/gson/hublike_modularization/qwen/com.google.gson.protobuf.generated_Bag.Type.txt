    "justification": "The class 'Bag.Type' has only one outgoing dependency to 'Bag' and one incoming dependency from 'Bag'. The dependencies listed are actually members or nested classes within 'Bag', not separate abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not interact with a large number of other abstractions."
