    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ArrayTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ArrayTypeAdapter has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (Gson). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with many abstractions directly. Additionally, Gson which depends on it has a very large number of dependencies (28), suggesting that ArrayTypeAdapter acts as a hub in the modularization structure by being a central point of interaction for multiple components."
