    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class RawCollectionsExample. The incoming dependency list shows only one source class with 4 dependencies, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
