    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.SimpleProto' has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag' and one incoming dependency from the same class. This does not indicate a large number of dependencies with other abstractions, thus it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
