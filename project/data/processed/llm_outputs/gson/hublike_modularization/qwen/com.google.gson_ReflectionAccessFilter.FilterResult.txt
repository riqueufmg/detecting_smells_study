    "class": "com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter.FilterResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class ReflectionAccessFilter. The low number of dependencies (only 1 incoming and 0 outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
