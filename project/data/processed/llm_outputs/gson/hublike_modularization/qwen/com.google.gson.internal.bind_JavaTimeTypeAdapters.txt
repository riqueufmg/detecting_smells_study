    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JavaTimeTypeAdapters",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaTimeTypeAdapters' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes/interfaces, but no incoming dependencies from other classes. While it interacts with several core Gson types like TypeAdapter, JsonReader, JsonWriter, and Gson, the number of dependencies is not excessively high given its role as a utility class for Java time type adapters. There's no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
