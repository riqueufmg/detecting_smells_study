{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Streams.CurrentWrite",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from com.google.gson.internal.Streams. The Streams class depends on 8 different abstractions, but CurrentWrite itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. CurrentWrite appears to be a simple, focused class with minimal coupling."
