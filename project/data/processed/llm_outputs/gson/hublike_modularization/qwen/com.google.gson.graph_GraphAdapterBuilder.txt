    "class": "com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder' has outgoing dependencies on 9 different classes across multiple packages including 'com.google.gson', 'com.google.gson.stream', 'com.google.gson.reflect', 'com.google.gson.internal', and nested classes within its own package. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization as it connects to a wide range of abstractions."
