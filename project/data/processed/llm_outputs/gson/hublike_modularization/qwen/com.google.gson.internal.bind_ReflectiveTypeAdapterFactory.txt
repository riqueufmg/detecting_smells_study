    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (20 unique classes) and also receives incoming dependencies from other classes such as 'TypeAdapterRuntimeTypeWrapper'. This indicates it acts as a hub by interacting with numerous other abstractions both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
