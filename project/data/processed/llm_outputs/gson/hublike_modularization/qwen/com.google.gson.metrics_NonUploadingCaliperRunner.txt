    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.metrics.NonUploadingCaliperRunner' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (SerializationBenchmark, BagOfPrimitivesDeserializationBenchmark, ParseBenchmark, CollectionsDeserializationBenchmark) and is referenced in their dependency lists. Although it has no outgoing dependencies, the high number of incoming dependencies from different abstractions indicates hub-like behavior where multiple classes depend on it."
