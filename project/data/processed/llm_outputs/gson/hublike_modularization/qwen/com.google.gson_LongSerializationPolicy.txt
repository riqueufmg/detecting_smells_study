{
    "class": "com.google.gson.LongSerializationPolicy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.LongSerializationPolicy' has only 2 outgoing dependencies (JsonElement, JsonNull) and appears in the dependencies of only 2 other classes (Gson, GsonBuilder). This limited number of connections does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
