{
    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JsonDeserializer has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (JsonParseException, JsonDeserializationContext, JsonElement) and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (TreeTypeAdapter, TreeTypeAdapter.SingleTypeFactory, JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory). Additionally, the dependent classes themselves have multiple dependencies, indicating that JsonDeserializer acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
