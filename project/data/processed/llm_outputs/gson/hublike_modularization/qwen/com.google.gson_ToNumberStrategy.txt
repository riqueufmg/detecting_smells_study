    "class": "com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy' has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader' and is depended upon by four other classes ('Gson', 'GsonBuilder', 'NumberTypeAdapter', 'ObjectTypeAdapter'). While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the number of outgoing dependencies is minimal, and it does not exhibit a high degree of both incoming and outgoing connections that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
