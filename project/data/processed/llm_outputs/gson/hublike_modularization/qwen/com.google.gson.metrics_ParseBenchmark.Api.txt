{
    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.Api",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ParseBenchmark class. The incoming dependencies show that ParseBenchmark depends on multiple classes including ParseBenchmark.Api, but this represents a normal usage pattern where an outer class references its inner class. The Api class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
