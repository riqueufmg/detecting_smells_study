    "class": "com.google.gson.Gson.FutureTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.Gson.FutureTypeAdapter' has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.google.gson.TypeAdapter' and one incoming dependency from 'com.google.gson.Gson'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and it does not exhibit hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
