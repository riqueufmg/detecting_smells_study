{
    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ProtoTypeAdapter with 8 dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessive for hub-like modularization, and the class appears to be a builder pattern implementation with limited scope rather than a central hub with widespread dependencies."
