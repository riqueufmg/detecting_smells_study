    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.EnumTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class EnumTypeAdapter has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (7) and only 1 incoming dependency. While it interacts with several core Gson types, the number of dependencies is not excessively high relative to typical modular systems, and there's no evidence from the provided data that it acts as a central hub connecting a large number of abstractions beyond its expected role in the Gson binding architecture."
