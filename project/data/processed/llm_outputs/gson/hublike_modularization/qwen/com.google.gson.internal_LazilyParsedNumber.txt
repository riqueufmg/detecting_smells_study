    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LazilyParsedNumber",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (NumberLimits) and 1 incoming dependency (TypeAdapters). While TypeAdapters has multiple dependencies, the LazilyParsedNumber class itself only has a single incoming dependency relationship. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions - it has minimal coupling with only essential dependencies."
