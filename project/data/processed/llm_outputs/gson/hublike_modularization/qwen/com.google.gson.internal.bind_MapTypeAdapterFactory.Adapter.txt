{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (JsonToken, JsonReaderInternalAccess, TypeAdapter, ObjectConstructor) and incoming dependencies from 1 class (MapTypeAdapterFactory) which itself has dependencies to 11 other classes. The analyzed class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, indicating hub-like modularization."
