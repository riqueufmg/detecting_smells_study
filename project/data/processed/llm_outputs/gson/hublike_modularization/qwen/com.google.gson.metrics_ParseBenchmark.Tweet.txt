    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.Tweet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ParseBenchmark class. The incoming dependencies show that ParseBenchmark depends on multiple classes including this one, but this class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class acts more as a dependency target rather than a hub with numerous connections."
