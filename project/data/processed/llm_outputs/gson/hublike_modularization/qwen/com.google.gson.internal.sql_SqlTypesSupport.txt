    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTypesSupport",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTypesSupport' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes: 'SqlDateTypeAdapter', 'SqlTimestampTypeAdapter', 'SqlTimeTypeAdapter', and 'TypeAdapterFactory'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes: 'Gson' and 'GsonBuilder'. This creates a hub-like structure where 'SqlTypesSupport' acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both upstream and downstream, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
