    "justification": "The class JsonStreamParser has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes across multiple packages including com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.internal.Streams, com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.JsonParseException, and com.google.gson.Strictness. Additionally, some of these dependent classes like JsonElement and Streams themselves have multiple dependencies, indicating that JsonStreamParser acts as a hub connecting to various parts of the system through its dependencies."
