{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTimestampTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (6) and only 1 incoming dependency. While it interacts with several core Gson classes (TypeToken, TypeAdapter, JsonReader, Gson, TypeAdapterFactory, JsonWriter), this is typical for a type adapter implementation within the Gson library. The dependencies are focused on its role as a SQL timestamp adapter and do not indicate hub-like behavior. The class does not show excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would characterize hub-like modularization."
