    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 26 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'JsonReader' acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
