    "class": "com.google.gson.FieldAttributes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FieldAttributes has no outgoing dependencies and only receives dependencies from two other classes (ExclusionStrategy and Excluder). While Excluder has multiple dependencies, the FieldAttributes class itself does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions - it only interacts with a small number of related classes within the Gson library."
