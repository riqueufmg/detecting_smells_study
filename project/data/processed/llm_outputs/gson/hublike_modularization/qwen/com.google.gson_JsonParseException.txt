{
    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonParseException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JsonParseException has incoming dependencies from 7 other classes, but no outgoing dependencies. While it is referenced by multiple classes, it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, which is a key characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The smell requires both incoming and outgoing dependencies to be excessive."
