    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain.TestClassNotAbstract",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from NoSerializedNameMain class. The incoming dependency references 5 classes including this one, but this represents a low number of dependencies that does not indicate hub-like modularization. The class itself shows minimal coupling behavior."
