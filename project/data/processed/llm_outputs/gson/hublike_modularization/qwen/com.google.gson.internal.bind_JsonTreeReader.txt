{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JsonTreeReader has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (JsonToken, JsonElement, JsonPrimitive, JsonObject, JsonArray) and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (TypeAdapter). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions."
