    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from com.example.Main, which imports 12 different classes including this one. While Main has many dependencies, this specific class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal coupling - only one incoming reference and no outgoing references."
