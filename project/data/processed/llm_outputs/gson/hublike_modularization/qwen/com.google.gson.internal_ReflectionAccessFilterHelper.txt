    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (ReflectionAccessFilter, ConstructorConstructor, ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory) and also has outgoing dependencies to AccessChecker. The number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates a hub-like role in the modularization."
