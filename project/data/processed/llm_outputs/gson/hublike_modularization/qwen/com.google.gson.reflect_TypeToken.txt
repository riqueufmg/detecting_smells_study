    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken' has a high number of incoming dependencies (30) from various classes across different packages, and also has outgoing dependencies to 'com.google.gson.internal.GsonTypes' and 'com.google.gson.internal.TroubleshootingGuide'. This pattern of having many incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
