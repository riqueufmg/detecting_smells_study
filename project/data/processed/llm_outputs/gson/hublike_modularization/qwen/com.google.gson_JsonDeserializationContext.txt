{
    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonDeserializationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JsonDeserializationContext has only 2 outgoing dependencies (JsonParseException and JsonElement) and 2 incoming dependencies (JsonDeserializer and ProtoTypeAdapter). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have a large number of dependencies with many other abstractions."
