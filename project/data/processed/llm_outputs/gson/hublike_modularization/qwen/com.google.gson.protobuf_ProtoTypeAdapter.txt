    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 different classes/interfaces, including core Gson types like JsonElement, JsonObject, JsonArray, JsonDeserializationContext, JsonSerializationContext, and related exceptions and enums. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with many different abstractions, creating a hub-like structure where this class acts as a central point connecting to numerous other components."
