    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper.AccessChecker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class ReflectionAccessFilterHelper. The low number of dependencies (only 1 incoming, 0 outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions."
