{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Excluder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Excluder' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes like 'Gson', 'TypeAdapter', 'JsonReader', and 'JsonWriter', indicating it interacts with multiple key components of the system. The incoming dependencies come from important classes such as 'Gson', 'GsonBuilder', and 'ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory', showing that it is widely used. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with various abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
