```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JsonTreeWriter has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (JsonElement, JsonNull, JsonPrimitive, JsonObject, JsonWriter, JsonArray) and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes (TypeAdapter, Gson). This indicates that JsonTreeWriter is highly connected to other abstractions in the system, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
