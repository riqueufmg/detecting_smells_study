```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter.SingleTypeFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies to JsonDeserializer, JsonSerializer, and TypeToken, which is not a large number of dependencies. There are no incoming dependencies from other classes. The dependency pattern shows normal modularization rather than hub-like behavior, as the class depends on a small, focused set of related abstractions for JSON serialization/deserialization functionality."
