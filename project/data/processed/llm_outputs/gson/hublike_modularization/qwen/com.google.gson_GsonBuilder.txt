    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.GsonBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. It interacts with a large number of abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
