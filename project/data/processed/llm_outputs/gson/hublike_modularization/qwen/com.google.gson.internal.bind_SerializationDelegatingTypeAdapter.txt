    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to com.google.gson.TypeAdapter and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency itself has multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has minimal dependencies."
