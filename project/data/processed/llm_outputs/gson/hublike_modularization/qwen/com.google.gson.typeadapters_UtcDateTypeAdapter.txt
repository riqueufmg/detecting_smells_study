{
    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.UtcDateTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (JsonToken, JsonWriter, JsonReader) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to classes within the same package (com.google.gson.stream) and do not indicate a large number of dependencies with other abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has a small, focused set of dependencies."
