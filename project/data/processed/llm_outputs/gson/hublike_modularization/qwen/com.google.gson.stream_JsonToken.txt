    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken' has incoming dependencies from 27 other classes and no outgoing dependencies. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions rely on this class, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
