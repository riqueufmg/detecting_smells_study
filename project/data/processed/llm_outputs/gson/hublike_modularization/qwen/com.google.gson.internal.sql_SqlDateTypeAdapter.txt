```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlDateTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. While it interacts with several core Gson classes (TypeAdapter, JsonReader, JsonWriter, Gson, TypeAdapterFactory), this level of connectivity is typical for adapter implementations in Gson library. The dependencies are focused on JSON serialization/deserialization functionality rather than being spread across unrelated modules. The single incoming dependency comes from a closely related class (SqlTypesSupport) that manages SQL type adapters, indicating a cohesive module rather than a hub-like structure."
