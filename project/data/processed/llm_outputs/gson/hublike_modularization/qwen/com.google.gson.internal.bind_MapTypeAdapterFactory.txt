{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class MapTypeAdapterFactory has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes, including core classes like Gson, TypeAdapter, TypeToken, and various internal binders and utilities. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with many other abstractions. Additionally, it defines an inner class Adapter, which also has its own dependencies, increasing the overall coupling. The class interacts with central components such as TypeAdapters, ConstructorConstructor, and Gson, which are hubs themselves, further contributing to hub-like modularization."
