{
    "class": "com.google.gson.InstanceCreator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.InstanceCreator' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor', 'com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor.InstanceCreatorConstructor', and 'com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder'. It also appears in the dependencies list of these classes, indicating bidirectional relationships. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies across different classes indicates hub-like modularization."
