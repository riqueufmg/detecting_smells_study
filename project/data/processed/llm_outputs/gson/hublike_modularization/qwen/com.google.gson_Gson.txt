    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.Gson' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (30) and incoming dependencies (30), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This extensive bidirectional dependency network suggests hub-like modularization where 'Gson' acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
