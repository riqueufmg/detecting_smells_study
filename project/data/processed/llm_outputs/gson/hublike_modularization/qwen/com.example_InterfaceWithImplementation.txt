{
    "class": "com.example.InterfaceWithImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from class Main. The incoming dependencies show that Main depends on this class along with 12 other classes, but the InterfaceWithImplementation class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class acts as a dependency target rather than a hub with numerous connections."
