    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.SerializationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SerializationBenchmark has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The dependencies are limited to NonUploadingCaliperRunner, BagOfPrimitives, and Gson. While Gson itself has many dependencies, the SerializationBenchmark class does not directly depend on those, and there are no incoming dependencies indicating other classes depend on it. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
