{
    "class": "com.example.TestExecutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from class Main. The incoming dependencies list shows Main depends on 13 classes including TestExecutor, but this represents Main's dependencies, not TestExecutor's incoming dependencies. TestExecutor itself has no dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
