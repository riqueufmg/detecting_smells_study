{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (EntrySet, KeySet, Node) and 1 incoming dependency (JsonObject). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
