    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters' has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
