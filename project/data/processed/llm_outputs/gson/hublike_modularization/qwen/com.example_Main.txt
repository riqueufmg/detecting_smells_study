```json
{
    "class": "com.example.Main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.example.Main' has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes, including 'com.google.gson.Gson' and 'com.google.gson.GsonBuilder', which themselves have numerous dependencies. This creates a hub-like modularization smell as the class connects to a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly through widely-used external libraries."
