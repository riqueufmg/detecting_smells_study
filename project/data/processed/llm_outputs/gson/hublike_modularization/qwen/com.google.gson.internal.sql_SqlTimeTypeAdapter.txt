{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTimeTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. While it interacts with several core Gson abstractions like TypeAdapter, Gson, and TypeAdapterFactory, the number of dependencies is not excessively high given its role as a type adapter. The incoming dependency is limited to one class (SqlTypesSupport), which manages SQL-related type adapters. There is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would classify it as hub-like modularization."
