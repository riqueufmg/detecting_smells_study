```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter.FilterResult' and 'com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper'. The incoming dependency is from 'com.google.gson.GsonBuilder' which lists many dependencies but only one of them is to this class. This does not indicate a large number of dependencies in either direction, thus it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
