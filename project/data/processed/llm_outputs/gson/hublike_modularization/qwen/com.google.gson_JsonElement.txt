{
    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JsonElement has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 21 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that JsonElement acts as a central hub connecting numerous abstractions within the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
