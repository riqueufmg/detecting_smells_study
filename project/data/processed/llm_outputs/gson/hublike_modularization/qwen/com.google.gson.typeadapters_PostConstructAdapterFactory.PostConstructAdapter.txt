    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to TypeAdapter and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency to TypeAdapter has 7 sub-dependencies, but this represents a single dependency relationship. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
