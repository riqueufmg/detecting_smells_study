{
    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.CollectionsDeserializationBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 different classes across multiple packages (com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.metrics.NonUploadingCaliperRunner, com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitives). Among these, Gson and JsonReader have extensive dependency chains with many internal classes, indicating that CollectionsDeserializationBenchmark acts as a hub connecting to numerous abstractions both directly and indirectly through its dependencies."
