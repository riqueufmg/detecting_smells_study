```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.PostConstructAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeToken, TypeAdapter, and Gson, which are core classes in the Gson library. While Gson itself has many dependencies, the PostConstructAdapterFactory does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit a high number of dependencies in either direction, thus does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
