    "justification": "The class 'Bag.Data' has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag' and one incoming dependency from the same class. The number of dependencies is not large enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
