{
    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.User",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ParseBenchmark class. The incoming dependencies show that ParseBenchmark depends on this class along with other classes in the same package, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
