    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.Parser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ParseBenchmark class. The incoming dependencies show that ParseBenchmark depends on this Parser class along with several other classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
