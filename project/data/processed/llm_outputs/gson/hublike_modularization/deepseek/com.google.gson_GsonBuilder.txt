    "class": "com.google.gson.GsonBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of dependencies: 15 outgoing dependencies (Excluder, ToNumberStrategy, FieldNamingPolicy, TypeToken, TypeAdapterFactory, Gson, DefaultDateTypeAdapter, LongSerializationPolicy, Strictness, ExclusionStrategy, FormattingStyle, ReflectionAccessFilter, SqlTypesSupport, TreeTypeAdapter, FieldNamingStrategy) and 4 incoming dependencies (Gson, GraphAdapterBuilder, NoSerializedNameMain, Main). This high count of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub, coordinating many other abstractions."
