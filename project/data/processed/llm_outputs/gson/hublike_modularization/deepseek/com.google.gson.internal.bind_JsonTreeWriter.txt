    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions (JsonPrimitive, JsonElement, JsonArray, JsonNull, JsonObject, JsonWriter) and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions (TypeAdapter, Gson). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, connecting many different parts of the system."
