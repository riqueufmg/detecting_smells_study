    "class": "com.google.gson.Strictness",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (6 classes: JsonParser, JsonStreamParser, JsonElement, Gson, GsonBuilder, JsonReader, JsonWriter). It has no outgoing dependencies, but the definition focuses on both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The count of 6 distinct dependent classes qualifies as a large number, indicating it is a central hub used by many other components."
