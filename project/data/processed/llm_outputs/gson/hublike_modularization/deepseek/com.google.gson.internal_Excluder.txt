    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 outgoing dependencies and 3 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 11 distinct dependency relationships. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates the class acts as a central hub, coupling many other abstractions."
