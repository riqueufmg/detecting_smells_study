    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to JsonReader) and three incoming dependencies (from MapTypeAdapterFactory, MapTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter, and JsonReader). This total of four distinct dependency connections does not constitute a large number of dependencies for a hub-like modularization smell."
