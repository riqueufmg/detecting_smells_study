    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct abstractions (ObjectUtils.Null, DurationUtils, StringUtils, StrBuilder, Suppliers) and incoming dependencies from 9 distinct abstractions (SerializationUtils, ArrayUtils, AnnotationUtils, StringUtils, HashCodeBuilder, ToStringStyle, CompareToBuilder, DiffBuilder, TypeUtils). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates a hub-like role."
