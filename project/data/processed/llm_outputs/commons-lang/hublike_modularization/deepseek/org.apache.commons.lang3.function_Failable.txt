    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 18 other abstractions (FailableLongConsumer, FailableCallable, etc.) and no incoming dependencies. This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a hub, centralizing relationships with many other classes in its package."
