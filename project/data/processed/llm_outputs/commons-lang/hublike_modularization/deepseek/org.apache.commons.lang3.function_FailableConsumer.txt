    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 10 incoming dependencies. While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the total number of distinct dependencies (incoming + outgoing) is 10, which does not indicate a hub-like structure with a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections."
