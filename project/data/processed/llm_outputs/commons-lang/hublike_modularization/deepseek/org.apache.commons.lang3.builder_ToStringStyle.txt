    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (ClassUtils, Strings, ObjectUtils, StringUtils) and incoming dependencies from 8 other classes (ArrayUtils, AnnotationUtils, ReflectionDiffBuilder, DiffBuilder, DiffBuilder.Builder, ReflectionToStringBuilder, ToStringBuilder, DiffResult), totaling 12 distinct dependencies. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
