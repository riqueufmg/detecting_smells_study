    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FastDateParser has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions (StrategyParser, Strategy, LocaleUtils, TimeZones, StrategyAndWidth, ISO8601TimeZoneStrategy) and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions (FastDateFormat, DateUtils). This creates a hub-like structure where FastDateParser acts as a central point connecting multiple components, both consuming and being consumed by various parts of the system, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
