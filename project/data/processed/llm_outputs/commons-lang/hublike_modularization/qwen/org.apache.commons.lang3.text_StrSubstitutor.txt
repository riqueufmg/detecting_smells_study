```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrSubstitutor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class StrSubstitutor has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (StrMatcher, StrLookup, StrBuilder, StringUtils) and receives incoming dependencies from no other classes. While the number of outgoing dependencies is relatively high, the key indicator is that StrSubstitutor acts as a central coordinator interacting with multiple abstractions in the text processing module, which aligns with hub-like modularization where a single class interacts with many others to fulfill its responsibilities."
