    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiFunction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (Failable, MethodInvokers, Pair) and also has outgoing dependency to FailableFunction. The number of incoming dependencies is relatively high, indicating that this class is involved in many interactions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
