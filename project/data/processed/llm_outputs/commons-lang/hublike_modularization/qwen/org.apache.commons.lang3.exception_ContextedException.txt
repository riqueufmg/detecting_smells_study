    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ContextedException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (DefaultExceptionContext and ExceptionContext) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to classes within the same package and do not indicate a large number of dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
