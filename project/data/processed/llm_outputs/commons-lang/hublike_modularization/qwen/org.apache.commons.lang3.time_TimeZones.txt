```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.TimeZones",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TimeZones' has incoming dependencies from 6 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies (from classes like 'DateUtils', 'FastDateParser', 'AbstractFormatCache', etc.) indicates that many abstractions depend on 'TimeZones', which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'JavaVersion' and 'SystemProperties', showing it also depends on multiple abstractions. This bidirectional dependency pattern with a large number of related abstractions confirms the presence of the Hub-like Modularization smell."
