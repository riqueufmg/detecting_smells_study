    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DiffResult has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (3), and none of these dependencies indicate a large number of interactions. The dependencies are confined to related builder classes and utilities within the same package and adjacent packages, which is typical for cohesive module design rather than hub-like modularization."
