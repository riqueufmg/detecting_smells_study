    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes across different packages including org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable, org.apache.commons.lang3.function.MethodInvokers, org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch, and several classes in org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent package. It is referenced by 9 different classes, indicating a high number of incoming dependencies which suggests hub-like modularization."
