{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils.Interfaces",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ClassUtils. The incoming dependency shows ClassUtils depends on ClassUtils.Interfaces along with ArrayUtils and StringUtils, but this represents a normal utility class relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
