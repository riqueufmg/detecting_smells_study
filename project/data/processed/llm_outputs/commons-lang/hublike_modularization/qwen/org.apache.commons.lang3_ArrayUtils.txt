{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ArrayUtils' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 16 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ArrayUtils' acts as a central hub connecting various parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
