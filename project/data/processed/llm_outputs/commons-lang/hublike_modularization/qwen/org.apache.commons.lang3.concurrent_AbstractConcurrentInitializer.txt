    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AbstractConcurrentInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies to distinct abstractions (ConcurrentException, FailableConsumer, FailableSupplier) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization patterns."
