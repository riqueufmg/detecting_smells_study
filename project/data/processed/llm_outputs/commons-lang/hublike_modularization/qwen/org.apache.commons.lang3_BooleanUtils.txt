    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BooleanUtils has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ArrayUtils and NumberUtils) and 3 incoming dependencies (ArrayUtils, MutableBoolean, InheritanceUtils), which does not indicate a large number of dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
