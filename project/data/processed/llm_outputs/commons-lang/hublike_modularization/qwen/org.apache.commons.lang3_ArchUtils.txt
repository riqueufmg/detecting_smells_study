    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ArchUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (SystemProperties and Processor) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies show a limited scope of interaction with closely related classes in the same package and sub-package, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
