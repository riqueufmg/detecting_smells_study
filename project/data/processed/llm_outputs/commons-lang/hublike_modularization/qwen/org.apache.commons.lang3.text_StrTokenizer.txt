    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class StrTokenizer has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (StrMatcher, ArrayUtils, StrBuilder, StringUtils) and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (StrBuilder). This creates a hub-like structure where StrTokenizer acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions, both consuming and being consumed by various components."
