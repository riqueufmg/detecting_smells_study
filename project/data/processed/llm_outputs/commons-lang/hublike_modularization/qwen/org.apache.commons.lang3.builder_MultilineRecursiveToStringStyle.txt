    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ClassUtils, StringUtils, and ReflectionToStringBuilder, which are all directly related to its functionality as a toString style builder. The number of dependencies is not excessive and they are cohesive to the class's purpose."
