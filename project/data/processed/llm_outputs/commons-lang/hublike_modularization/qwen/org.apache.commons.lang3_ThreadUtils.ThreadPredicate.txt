    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils.ThreadPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ThreadUtils class. The incoming dependency shows usage by ThreadUtils which contains 4 dependencies including this class, but this does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class appears to be a simple predicate interface implementation with minimal coupling."
