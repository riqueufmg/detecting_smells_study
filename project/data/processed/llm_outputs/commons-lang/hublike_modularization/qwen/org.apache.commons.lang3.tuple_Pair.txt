    "justification": "The class Pair has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (2). The outgoing dependencies are to FailableBiFunction, ImmutablePair, and FailableBiConsumer. The incoming dependencies are from ImmutablePair and EqualsBuilder. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show excessive or centralizing dependency relationships within the provided context."
