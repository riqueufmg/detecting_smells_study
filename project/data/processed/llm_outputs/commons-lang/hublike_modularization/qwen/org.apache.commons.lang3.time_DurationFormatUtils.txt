{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (DurationFormatUtils.Token, DateUtils, Strings, StringUtils) and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (StopWatch). This creates a hub-like structure where DurationFormatUtils acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both upstream and downstream."
