    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeLiteral",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TypeLiteral has only one outgoing dependency to TypeUtils and no incoming dependencies. The dependency graph shows TypeLiteral connects to only one other class directly, which is below the threshold for hub-like modularization. While TypeUtils itself has multiple dependencies, these are not direct dependencies of TypeLiteral, and the analysis must consider the class in isolation."
