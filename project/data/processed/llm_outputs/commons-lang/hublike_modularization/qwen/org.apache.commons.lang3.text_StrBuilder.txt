{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class StrBuilder has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (StrMatcher, Strings, CharUtils, ArrayUtils, StringUtils, StrTokenizer) and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (ObjectUtils, StrSubstitutor, StrTokenizer). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where StrBuilder acts as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
