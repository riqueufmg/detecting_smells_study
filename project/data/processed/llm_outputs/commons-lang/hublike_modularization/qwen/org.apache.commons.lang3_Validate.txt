    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Validate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Validate' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (ClassUtils and StringUtils) and incoming dependencies from 2 classes (ExtendedMessageFormat and TypeUtils). Considering the class in isolation and the provided dependencies, it acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
