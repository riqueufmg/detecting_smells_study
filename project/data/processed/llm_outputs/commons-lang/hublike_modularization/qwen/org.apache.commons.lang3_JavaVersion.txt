    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavaVersion has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (RegExUtils, SystemProperties, NumberUtils) and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (SystemUtils, TimeZones, FieldUtils). This creates a hub-like structure where JavaVersion acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, satisfying the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
