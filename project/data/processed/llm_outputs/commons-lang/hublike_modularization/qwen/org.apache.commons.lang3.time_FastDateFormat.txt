    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FastDateFormat has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (FastDatePrinter, AbstractFormatCache, FastDateParser) and incoming dependencies from 1 class (DateFormatUtils). While the number of direct dependencies is not extremely high, the class acts as a central coordinator for date formatting operations, delegating to multiple specialized components, which indicates hub-like behavior in its modularization."
