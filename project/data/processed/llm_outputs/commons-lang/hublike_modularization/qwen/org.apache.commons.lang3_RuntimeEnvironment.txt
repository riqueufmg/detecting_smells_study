{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RuntimeEnvironment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (StringUtils and CharUtils) and no incoming dependencies. While StringUtils has many outgoing dependencies (9 classes), the RuntimeEnvironment class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it only directly depends on 2 other classes and is not depended upon by any other classes."
