    "justification": "The class 'LangCollectors' has outgoing dependencies to 'StringUtils' which itself has dependencies to 9 other classes. Additionally, 'LangCollectors' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'StringUtils' and 'MethodUtils', each depending on several other classes. This creates a hub-like structure where 'LangCollectors' is central to many dependencies both incoming and outgoing, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
