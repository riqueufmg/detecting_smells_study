{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableConsumer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies but has incoming dependencies from 10 different classes across multiple packages including org.apache.commons.lang3.function, org.apache.commons.lang3.event, org.apache.commons.lang3.time, and org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent. The high number of incoming dependencies (10) with no outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization where this class is heavily depended upon by other abstractions."
