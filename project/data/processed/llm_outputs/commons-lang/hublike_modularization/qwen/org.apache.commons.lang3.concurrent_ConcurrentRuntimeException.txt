    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.ConcurrentRuntimeException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to ConcurrentUtils and one incoming dependency from ConcurrentUtils. The dependency relationships are minimal and do not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
