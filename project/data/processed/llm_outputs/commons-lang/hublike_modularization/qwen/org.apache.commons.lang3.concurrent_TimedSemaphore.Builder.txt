{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.TimedSemaphore.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class TimedSemaphore. The low number of dependencies (only 1 incoming, 0 outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
