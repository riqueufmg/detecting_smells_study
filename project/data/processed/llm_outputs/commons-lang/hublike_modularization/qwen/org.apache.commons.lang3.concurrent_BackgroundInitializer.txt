    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and incoming dependencies (1). It does not exhibit a high number of dependencies with other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are focused and related to its specific functionality as a background initializer."
