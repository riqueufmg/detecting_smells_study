    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 class (ConcurrentUtils) and incoming dependencies from 8 classes (LazyInitializer, AtomicSafeInitializer, AbstractConcurrentInitializer, ConstantInitializer, AtomicInitializer, ConcurrentUtils, BackgroundInitializer, MultiBackgroundInitializer). This high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
