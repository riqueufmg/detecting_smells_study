    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils.WildcardTypeBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from TypeUtils class. The incoming dependency shows TypeUtils uses this class along with 6 other classes/utilities, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for WildcardTypeBuilder itself. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
