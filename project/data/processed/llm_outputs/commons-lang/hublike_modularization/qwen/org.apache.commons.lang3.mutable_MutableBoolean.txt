{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable.MutableBoolean",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to BooleanUtils and no incoming dependencies. The dependency graph shows minimal connectivity with only 1 outgoing edge and 0 incoming edges, which does not indicate hub-like behavior where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
