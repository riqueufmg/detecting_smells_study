{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.TimedSemaphore",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to its inner Builder class and no incoming dependencies from other classes. The low number of dependencies (only 1 outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
