    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from RandomStringUtils. The incoming dependency count (1) and outgoing dependency count (0) are both below typical thresholds for hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
