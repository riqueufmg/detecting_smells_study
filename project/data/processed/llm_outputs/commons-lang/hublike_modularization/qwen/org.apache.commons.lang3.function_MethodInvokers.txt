    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple classes within the same package, the number of dependencies is not excessive and does not indicate hub-like behavior. The class appears to be a utility class that aggregates functionality from related functional interfaces without creating a hub-like dependency structure."
