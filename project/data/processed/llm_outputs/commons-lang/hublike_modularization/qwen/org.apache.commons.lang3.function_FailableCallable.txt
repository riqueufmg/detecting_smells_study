    "justification": "The class FailableCallable has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from class Failable which contains 18 dependencies. While the Failable class shows hub-like characteristics with many dependencies, FailableCallable itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal direct dependencies."
