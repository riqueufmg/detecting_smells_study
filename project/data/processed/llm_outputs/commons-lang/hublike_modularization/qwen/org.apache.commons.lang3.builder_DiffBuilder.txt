{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.DiffBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class DiffBuilder has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions (ObjectUtils, SerializableSupplier, ArrayUtils, Builder, ToStringStyle, DiffResult) and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions (ReflectionDiffBuilder, ReflectionDiffBuilder.Builder). This creates a hub-like structure where DiffBuilder acts as a central point connecting multiple components, both consuming and being consumed by numerous other classes, which characterizes the Hub-like Modularization smell."
