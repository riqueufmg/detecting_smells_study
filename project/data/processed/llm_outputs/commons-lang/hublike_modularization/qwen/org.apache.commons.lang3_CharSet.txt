{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (CharRange and StringUtils) and 1 incoming dependency (CharSetUtils). While StringUtils has many dependencies, the CharSet class itself does not have a large number of direct dependencies in either direction, indicating it is not hub-like in its modularization."
