{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ObjectUtils and SerializationUtils.ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
