    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils.CsvEscaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Strings and CharUtils) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have further dependencies, but the analyzed class directly depends on only 2 other abstractions, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies indicative of hub-like modularization."
