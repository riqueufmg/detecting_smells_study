```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionDiffBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionDiffBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions: 'ReflectionDiffBuilder.Builder', 'FieldUtils', 'ClassUtils', 'ArrayUtils', 'ToStringStyle', 'DiffBuilder', and 'DiffResult'. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with many other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies, meaning this class depends on many others but is not depended upon, reinforcing the hub-like behavior where it acts as a central coordinator or consumer of multiple components."
