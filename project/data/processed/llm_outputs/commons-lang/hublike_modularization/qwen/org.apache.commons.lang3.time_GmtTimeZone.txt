    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.GmtTimeZone",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to TimeZones and 0 incoming dependencies. The dependency graph shows limited connections, which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
