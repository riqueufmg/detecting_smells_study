{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils.Null",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ObjectUtils class. The incoming dependency list shows ObjectUtils depends on 5 classes including ObjectUtils.Null, but this represents the dependency direction from ObjectUtils to other classes, not to ObjectUtils.Null specifically. ObjectUtils.Null itself has no dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
