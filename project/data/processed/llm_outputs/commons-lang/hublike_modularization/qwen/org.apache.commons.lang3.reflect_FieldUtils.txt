    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.FieldUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FieldUtils has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (MemberUtils, ClassUtils, ArrayUtils, SystemUtils, JavaVersion, StringUtils) and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (ReflectionDiffBuilder). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as FieldUtils acts as a central point connecting to many other abstractions in the system."
