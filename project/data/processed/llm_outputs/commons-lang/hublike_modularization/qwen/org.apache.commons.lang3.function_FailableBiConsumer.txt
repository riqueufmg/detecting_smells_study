    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes across different packages including org.apache.commons.lang3, org.apache.commons.lang3.time, and org.apache.commons.lang3.tuple. It is referenced by classes such as AppendableJoiner, AppendableJoiner.Builder, Failable, MethodInvokers, DurationUtils, and Pair, indicating a high number of incoming dependencies which suggests hub-like modularization."
