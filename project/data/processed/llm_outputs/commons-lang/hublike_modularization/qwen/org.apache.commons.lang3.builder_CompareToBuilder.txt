    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it does depend on other classes, the number of dependencies is not excessive for typical modularization patterns. Hub-like Modularization typically involves a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not present here."
