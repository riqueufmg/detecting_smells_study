{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.LazyInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to related classes in the same package (ConcurrentException, LazyInitializer.Builder) and functional interfaces (FailableSupplier, FailableConsumer). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
