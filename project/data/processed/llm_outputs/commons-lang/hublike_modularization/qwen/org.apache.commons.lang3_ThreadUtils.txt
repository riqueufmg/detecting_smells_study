```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies to specific predicate classes and one external Predicates class. There are no incoming dependencies from other classes. The number of dependencies is relatively small and focused, not indicating hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
