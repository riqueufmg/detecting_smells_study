    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableDoubleConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Failable class. The Failable class depends on multiple classes in the same package, but this does not indicate that FailableDoubleConsumer itself has hub-like modularization since it does not directly depend on or connect to a large number of other abstractions."
