    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CharUtils has incoming dependencies from 9 different classes (RuntimeEnvironment, StringEscapeUtils, StringEscapeUtils.CsvEscaper, StringEscapeUtils.CsvUnescaper, ArrayUtils, StringUtils, NumberUtils, StrBuilder, OctalUnescaper, NumericEntityUnescaper, FastDatePrinter) and outgoing dependencies to 1 class (StringUtils), demonstrating hub-like modularization due to its high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with other abstractions."
