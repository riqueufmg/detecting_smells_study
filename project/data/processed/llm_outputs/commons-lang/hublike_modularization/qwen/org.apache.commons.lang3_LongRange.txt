    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.LongRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class LongRange has only one incoming dependency from DurationUtils which depends on 6 classes including LongRange, but LongRange itself has no outgoing dependencies. The metric data shows minimal dependency connections rather than a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
