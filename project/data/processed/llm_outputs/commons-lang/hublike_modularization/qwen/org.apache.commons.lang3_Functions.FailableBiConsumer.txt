{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailableBiConsumer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Functions class. The incoming dependency shows that Functions references this class along with 9 other similar functional interfaces, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
