    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrLookup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class StrLookup has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from StrSubstitutor. The incoming dependency shows StrSubstitutor depends on StrLookup along with other classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for StrLookup itself. StrLookup appears to be a simple abstraction with minimal dependencies."
