    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CalendarUtils has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from FastDatePrinter, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not present in this case."
