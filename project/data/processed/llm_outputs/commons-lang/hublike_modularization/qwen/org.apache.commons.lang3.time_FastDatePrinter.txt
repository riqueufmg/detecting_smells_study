    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FastDatePrinter has outgoing dependencies to 20 other classes/interfaces, including multiple inner classes and external utilities. It also has incoming dependencies from FastDateFormat which depends on it along with other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization where FastDatePrinter acts as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
