{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch.SplitState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from StopWatch class. The incoming dependency shows StopWatch depends on SplitState, but this represents a simple dependency relationship rather than hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
