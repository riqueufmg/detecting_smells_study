    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateFormatUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to FastDateFormat and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
