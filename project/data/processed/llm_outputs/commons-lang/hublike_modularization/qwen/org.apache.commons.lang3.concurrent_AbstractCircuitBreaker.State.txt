    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency from AbstractCircuitBreaker and no outgoing dependencies, indicating minimal connectivity rather than hub-like modularization. A hub-like structure would require dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not present here."
