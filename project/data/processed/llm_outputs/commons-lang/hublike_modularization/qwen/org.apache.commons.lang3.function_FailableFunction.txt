    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableFunction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableFunction' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils' which depends on 7 different abstractions, and 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable' which depends on 18 different abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableBiFunction' and 'org.apache.commons.lang3.function.MethodInvokers'. This indicates that the class is involved in a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
