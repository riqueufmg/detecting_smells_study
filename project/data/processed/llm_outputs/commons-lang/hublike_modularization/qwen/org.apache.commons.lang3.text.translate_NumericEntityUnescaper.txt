    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (NumericEntityUnescaper.OPTION and CharUtils) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, not indicating hub-like modularization where there would be dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
