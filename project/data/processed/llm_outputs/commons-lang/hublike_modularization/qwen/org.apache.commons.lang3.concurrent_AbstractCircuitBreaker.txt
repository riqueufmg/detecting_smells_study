    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AbstractCircuitBreaker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to its inner class State) and 1 incoming dependency (from EventCountCircuitBreaker). The number of dependencies is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where there would be dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
