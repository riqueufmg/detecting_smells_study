    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class NumberUtils has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (StringUtils and CharUtils) and incoming dependencies from 3 classes (BooleanUtils, JavaVersion, DurationUtils). The outgoing dependencies from StringUtils alone include 9 other classes, indicating that StringUtils acts as a hub. Since NumberUtils depends on this hub class, it participates in hub-like modularization. Additionally, NumberUtils is depended upon by multiple classes across different packages, further increasing its connectivity and reinforcing the hub-like structure."
