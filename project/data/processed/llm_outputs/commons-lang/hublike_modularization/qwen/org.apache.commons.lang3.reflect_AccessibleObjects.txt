    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.AccessibleObjects",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from MethodUtils and MemberUtils, and no outgoing dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
