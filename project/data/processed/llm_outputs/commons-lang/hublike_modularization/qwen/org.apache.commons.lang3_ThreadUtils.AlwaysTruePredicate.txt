    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils.AlwaysTruePredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ThreadUtils class. The incoming dependency shows ThreadUtils uses this class along with other related classes (ThreadPredicate, ThreadGroupPredicate) and Predicates, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
