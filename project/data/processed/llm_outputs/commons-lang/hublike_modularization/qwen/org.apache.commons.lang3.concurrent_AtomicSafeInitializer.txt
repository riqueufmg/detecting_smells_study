{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicSafeInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to related classes in the same package (ConcurrentException, AtomicSafeInitializer.Builder) and functional interfaces (FailableConsumer, FailableSupplier). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
