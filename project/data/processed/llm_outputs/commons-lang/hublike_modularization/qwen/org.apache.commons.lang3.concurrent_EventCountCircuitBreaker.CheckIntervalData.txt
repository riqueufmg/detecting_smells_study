    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.EventCountCircuitBreaker.CheckIntervalData",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from EventCountCircuitBreaker. The incoming dependency shows EventCountCircuitBreaker depends on this class along with two other classes (AbstractCircuitBreaker and AbstractStateStrategy), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
