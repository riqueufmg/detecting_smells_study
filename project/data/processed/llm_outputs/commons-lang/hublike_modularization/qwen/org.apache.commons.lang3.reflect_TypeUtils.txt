    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeUtils' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'TypeUtils' acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of abstractions."
