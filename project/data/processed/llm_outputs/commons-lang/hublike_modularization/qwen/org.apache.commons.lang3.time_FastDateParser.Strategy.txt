    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from FastDateParser class. The incoming dependency list shows FastDateParser depends on 6 different classes/dependencies, but this represents incoming relationships to StrategyParser, not outgoing dependencies from Strategy. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous bidirectional dependencies."
