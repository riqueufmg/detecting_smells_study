    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicInitializer.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from AtomicInitializer class. The incoming dependencies show that AtomicInitializer uses this Builder class along with ConcurrentException, FailableConsumer, and FailableSupplier, but this represents a normal usage pattern where the main class interacts with its supporting types rather than hub-like modularization with many diverse dependencies."
