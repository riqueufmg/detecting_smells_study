    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.lang3.Strings' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes and incoming dependencies from 9 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by many other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
