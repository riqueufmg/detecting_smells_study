    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 4 different classes (StringEscapeUtils, JavaUnicodeEscaper, UnicodeEscaper, AggregateTranslator) and serves as a central abstraction that other translators depend on, indicating hub-like modularization where this class acts as a dependency hub for multiple other abstractions"
