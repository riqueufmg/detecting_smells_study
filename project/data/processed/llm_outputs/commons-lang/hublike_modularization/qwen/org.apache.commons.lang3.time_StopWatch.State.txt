```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from StopWatch class. The incoming dependency from StopWatch shows a direct dependency relationship where StopWatch uses StopWatch.State, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
