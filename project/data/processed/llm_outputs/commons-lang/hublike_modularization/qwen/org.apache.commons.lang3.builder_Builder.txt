{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from DiffBuilder. The incoming dependency shows DiffBuilder depends on Builder along with 5 other classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for Builder itself. Builder appears to be a simple interface/abstraction with minimal dependencies, not acting as a hub that connects to many other abstractions."
