    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.AbstractFormatCache.ArrayKey",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from AbstractFormatCache. The incoming dependency shows that AbstractFormatCache uses this class along with LocaleUtils and TimeZones, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for ArrayKey itself. ArrayKey appears to be a simple data structure used by its enclosing class with minimal dependencies."
