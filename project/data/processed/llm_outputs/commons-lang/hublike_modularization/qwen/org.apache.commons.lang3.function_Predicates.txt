    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Predicates",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils, which references multiple predicates including this class. The low number of dependencies (1 incoming, 0 outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization where there would be dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
