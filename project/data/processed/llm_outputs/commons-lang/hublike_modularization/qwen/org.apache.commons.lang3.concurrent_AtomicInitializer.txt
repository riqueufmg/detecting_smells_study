{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.AtomicInitializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to related classes in the same package (ConcurrentException, AtomicInitializer.Builder) and function interfaces (FailableConsumer, FailableSupplier). This represents a focused set of dependencies rather than a large number of dependencies with many abstractions, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
