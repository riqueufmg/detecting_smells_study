    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemProperties",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SystemProperties' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (Suppliers, ClassUtils, StringUtils) and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes (JavaVersion, SystemUtils, EnumUtils, ArchUtils, TimeZones). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions in the system."
