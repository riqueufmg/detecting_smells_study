    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (RandomUtils, StringUtils, CachedRandomBits) and no incoming dependencies. While StringUtils itself has many dependencies (9 classes), this does not make RandomStringUtils a hub-like module since it directly depends on only a small number of classes. The metric counts direct dependencies, not transitive ones."
