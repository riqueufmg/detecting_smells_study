{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtils.ModifyType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from DateUtils class. The incoming dependency shows DateUtils uses ModifyType along with other classes (LocaleUtils, TimeZones, FastDateParser), but this represents normal usage patterns rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
