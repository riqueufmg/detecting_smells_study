    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.StrategyParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from FastDateParser. The incoming dependency shows FastDateParser depends on 6 elements including this class, but this represents a normal parent-child relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit excessive dependencies in either direction."
