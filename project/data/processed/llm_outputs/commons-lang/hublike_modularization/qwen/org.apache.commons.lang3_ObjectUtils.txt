{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ObjectUtils has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 9 other classes, indicating it interacts with a large number of abstractions both ways. Additionally, analyzing the dependencies shows that ObjectUtils is referenced by multiple builder classes (HashCodeBuilder, ToStringStyle, CompareToBuilder, DiffBuilder) and utility classes (SerializationUtils, ArrayUtils, AnnotationUtils, StringUtils, TypeUtils), which demonstrates hub-like behavior where it acts as a central point for dependency interactions."
