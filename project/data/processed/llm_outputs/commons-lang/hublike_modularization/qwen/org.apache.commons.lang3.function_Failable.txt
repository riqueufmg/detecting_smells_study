    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.Failable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Failable' has outgoing dependencies to 18 other classes within the same package, all of which have no further dependencies. This indicates that 'Failable' acts as a central hub coordinating interactions with numerous related abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
