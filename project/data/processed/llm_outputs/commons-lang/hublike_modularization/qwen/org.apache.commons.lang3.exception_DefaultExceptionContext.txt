{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.DefaultExceptionContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Strings and ExceptionUtils) and 2 incoming dependencies (ContextedRuntimeException and ContextedException). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
