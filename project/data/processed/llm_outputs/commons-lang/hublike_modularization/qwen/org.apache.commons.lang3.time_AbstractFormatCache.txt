    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.AbstractFormatCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to LocaleUtils, TimeZones, and AbstractFormatCache.ArrayKey. The incoming dependency is from FastDateFormat. This level of dependency is not indicative of hub-like modularization as it does not show a large number of dependencies in both directions."
