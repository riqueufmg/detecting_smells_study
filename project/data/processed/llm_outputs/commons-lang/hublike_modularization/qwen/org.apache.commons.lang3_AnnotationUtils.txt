    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationUtils' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes, but no incoming dependencies from other classes within the provided data. While it depends on multiple abstractions, it does not exhibit hub-like behavior since it is not a central point of dependency for other classes in the analyzed scope."
