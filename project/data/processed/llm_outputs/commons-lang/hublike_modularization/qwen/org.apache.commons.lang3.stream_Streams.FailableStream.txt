    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.stream.Streams.FailableStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class Streams. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
