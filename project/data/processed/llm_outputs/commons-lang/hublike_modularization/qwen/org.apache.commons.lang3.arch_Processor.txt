{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.arch.Processor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Processor.Type and Processor.Arch) and 1 incoming dependency (ArchUtils). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
