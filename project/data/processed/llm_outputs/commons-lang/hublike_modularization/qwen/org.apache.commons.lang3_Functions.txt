    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other abstractions, all of which are inner classes or related functional interfaces. While there are no incoming dependencies, the high number of outgoing dependencies (greater than typical thresholds for hub-like modularization) indicates that this class acts as a central hub coordinating access to various functional interface implementations."
