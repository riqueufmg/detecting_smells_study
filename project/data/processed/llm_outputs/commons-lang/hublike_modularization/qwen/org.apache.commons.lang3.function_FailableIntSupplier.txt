    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.function.FailableIntSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the class Failable, which itself depends on multiple classes in the same package. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
