    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from DurationFormatUtils. The incoming dependency shows DurationFormatUtils depends on this class along with DateUtils, Strings, and StringUtils, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the Token class itself. The Token class appears to be a simple dependent class with limited coupling."
