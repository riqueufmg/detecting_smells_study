{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.locks.LockingVisitors",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies to its inner classes (StampedLockVisitor, ReadWriteLockVisitor, ReentrantLockVisitor) and no incoming dependencies from other classes. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
