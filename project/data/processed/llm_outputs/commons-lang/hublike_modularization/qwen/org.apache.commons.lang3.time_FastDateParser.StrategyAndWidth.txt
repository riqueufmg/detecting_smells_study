    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.StrategyAndWidth",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from FastDateParser. The incoming dependency shows FastDateParser depends on 6 classes including this one, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for StrategyAndWidth itself. StrategyAndWidth appears to be a simple data holder class with minimal dependencies."
