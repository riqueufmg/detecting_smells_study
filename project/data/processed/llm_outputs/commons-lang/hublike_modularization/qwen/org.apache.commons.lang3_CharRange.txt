```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies (from CharSet and CharRange.CharacterIterator) and no outgoing dependencies. The number of dependencies is small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
