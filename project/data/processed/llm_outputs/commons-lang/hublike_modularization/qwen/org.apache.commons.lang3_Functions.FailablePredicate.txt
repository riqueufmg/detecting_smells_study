    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.Functions.FailablePredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Functions class, which is its enclosing class. The incoming dependency shows the Functions class referencing multiple Failable* classes including this one, but this represents a normal inner class relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
