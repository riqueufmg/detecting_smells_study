```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrMatcher",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrMatcher' has incoming dependencies from 4 other classes (StrSubstitutor, StrTokenizer, StrBuilder, ExtendedMessageFormat) and outgoing dependencies to 1 class (StringUtils), which in turn has dependencies to 9 other classes. This creates a hub-like dependency structure where StrMatcher acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both directly and indirectly."
