{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.CharSetUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (CharSet and StringUtils) and no incoming dependencies. While StringUtils has many dependencies itself, the analysis must consider the class in isolation and the provided data shows limited direct dependencies for CharSetUtils, not indicating hub-like modularization."
