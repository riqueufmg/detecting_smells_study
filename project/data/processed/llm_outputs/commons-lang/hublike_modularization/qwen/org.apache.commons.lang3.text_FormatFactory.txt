{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.FormatFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FormatFactory has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ExtendedMessageFormat. The incoming dependency list shows ExtendedMessageFormat depends on 5 classes including FormatFactory, but this represents only one dependent class, not a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
