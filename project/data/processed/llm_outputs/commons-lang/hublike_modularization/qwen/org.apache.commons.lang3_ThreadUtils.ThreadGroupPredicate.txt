{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.ThreadUtils.ThreadGroupPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ThreadUtils class. The incoming dependency shows that ThreadUtils uses this class along with other predicate classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
