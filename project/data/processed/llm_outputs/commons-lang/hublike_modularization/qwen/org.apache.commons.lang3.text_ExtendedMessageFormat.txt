    "class": "org.apache.commons.lang3.text.ExtendedMessageFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ExtendedMessageFormat has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (StrMatcher, Validate, FormatFactory, StringUtils, LocaleUtils), which is a relatively high number, indicating it interacts with many other abstractions. Additionally, it has no incoming dependencies, but its outgoing dependency count suggests it acts as a hub connecting to multiple components."
