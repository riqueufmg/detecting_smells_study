    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 abstraction (FormatException) and incoming dependencies from 7 other abstractions (ECIEncoderSet, ECIStringBuilder, PDF417HighLevelEncoder, DecodedBitStreamParser, Encoder, Decoder, HighLevelEncoder). This high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, being widely used and also depending on other classes."
