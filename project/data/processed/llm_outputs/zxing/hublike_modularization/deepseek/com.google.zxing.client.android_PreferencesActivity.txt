    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (10 distinct classes: CameraConfigurationManager, AutoFocusManager, FrontLightMode, BeepManager, PreferencesFragment, CaptureActivity, DecodeThread, LocaleManager, HistoryManager, ResultHandler). It has no outgoing dependencies, indicating it is a central hub being used by many other abstractions."
