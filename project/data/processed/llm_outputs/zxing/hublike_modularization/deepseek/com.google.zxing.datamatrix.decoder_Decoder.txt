    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct abstractions (DecodedBitStreamParser, ReedSolomonDecoder, DataBlock, ChecksumException, GenericGF, Version, BitMatrix, BitMatrixParser, DecoderResult) and incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction (DataMatrixReader). The total number of distinct dependency connections is 10, which is a large number of dependencies for a single class, indicating it acts as a hub."
