    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (FinderPattern) and four incoming dependencies (MultiDetector, MultiFinderPatternFinder, FinderPatternFinder, Detector). The total number of distinct dependency connections is low, not indicating a large number of dependencies in both directions that would characterize a hub."
