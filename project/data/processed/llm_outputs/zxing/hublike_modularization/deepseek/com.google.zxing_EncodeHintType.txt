    "class": "com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (10 distinct classes) from various packages, including CommandLineEncoder, QRCodeEncoder, ChartServlet, Code128Writer, OneDimensionalCodeWriter, PDF417Writer, QRCodeWriter, Encoder, DataMatrixWriter, and AztecWriter. It has no outgoing dependencies, but the large number of incoming dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub used by many other abstractions."
