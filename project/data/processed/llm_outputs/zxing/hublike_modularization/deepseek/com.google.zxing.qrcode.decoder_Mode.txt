    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (Version) and is used by seven incoming dependencies (DecodedBitStreamParser, Encoder, MinimalEncoder, MinimalEncoder.Edge, MinimalEncoder.ResultList, MinimalEncoder.ResultNode, QRCode). This does not constitute a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies relative to typical hub-like modularization thresholds."
