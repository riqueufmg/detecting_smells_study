    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 class (GenericGFPoly) and incoming dependencies from 10 distinct classes (Decoder from maxicode, GenericGFPoly, ReedSolomonEncoder, ReedSolomonDecoder, Decoder from qrcode, Encoder from qrcode, Decoder from datamatrix, Detector from aztec, Decoder from aztec, Encoder from aztec). This large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub."
