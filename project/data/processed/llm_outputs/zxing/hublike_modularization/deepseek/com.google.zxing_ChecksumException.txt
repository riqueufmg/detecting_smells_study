    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and 10 incoming dependencies. While the number of incoming dependencies is moderately high, the total number of distinct dependencies (incoming + outgoing) is 10, which does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies with other abstractions to qualify as a hub."
