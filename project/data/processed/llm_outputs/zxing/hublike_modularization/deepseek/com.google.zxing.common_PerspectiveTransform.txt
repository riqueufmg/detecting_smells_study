    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero outgoing dependencies and only three incoming dependencies (from DefaultGridSampler, GridSampler, and Detector). This low number of total dependencies does not meet the threshold for a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
