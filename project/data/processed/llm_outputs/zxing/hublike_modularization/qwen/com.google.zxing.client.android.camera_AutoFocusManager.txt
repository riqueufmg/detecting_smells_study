    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.AutoFocusManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (PreferencesActivity and AutoFocusTask) and 1 incoming dependency (CameraManager). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
