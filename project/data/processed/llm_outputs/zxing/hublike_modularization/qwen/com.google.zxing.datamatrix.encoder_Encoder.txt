    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.Encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Encoder class has only 1 outgoing dependency (EncoderContext) and 1 incoming dependency (HighLevelEncoder). The total number of dependencies is small, indicating limited connectivity rather than hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
