    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.CodaBarWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BarcodeFormat and CodaBarReader) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are minimal and focused on related functionality within the same package (oned) and core ZXing framework. There is no evidence of excessive dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
