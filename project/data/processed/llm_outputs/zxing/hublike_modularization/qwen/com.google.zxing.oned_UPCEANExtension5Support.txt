    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANExtension5Support",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (6) and only 1 incoming dependency. While it interacts with several core classes in the zxing library, the dependency count does not indicate hub-like behavior. The incoming dependency count is particularly low, suggesting it is not a central hub. Hub-like modularization typically involves both high incoming and outgoing dependency counts, which is not observed here."
