    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResult",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResult' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'BarcodeMetadata', 'Codeword', 'DetectionResultColumn', 'PDF417Common', and 'BoundingBox'. The incoming dependencies originate from 'PDF417ScanningDecoder', which depends on multiple classes including the analyzed class. This pattern of having multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
