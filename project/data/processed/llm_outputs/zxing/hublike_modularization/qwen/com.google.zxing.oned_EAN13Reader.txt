{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.EAN13Reader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (BitArray, NotFoundException, BarcodeFormat) and 1 incoming dependency (EAN13Writer). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as the class is not connected to a large number of other abstractions either incoming or outgoing."
