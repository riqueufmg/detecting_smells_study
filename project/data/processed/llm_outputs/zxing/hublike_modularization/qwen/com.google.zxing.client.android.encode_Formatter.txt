    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Formatter class has only incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (VCardContactEncoder, ContactEncoder, MECARDContactEncoder) and no outgoing dependencies. While it is depended upon by multiple classes, the number of dependencies is not excessive given the CONTEXT_SIZE of 415, and it does not exhibit hub-like characteristics of having dependencies with a large number of abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
