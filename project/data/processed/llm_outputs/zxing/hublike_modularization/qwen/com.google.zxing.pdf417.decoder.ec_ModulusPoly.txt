    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ModulusPoly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ModulusPoly has only one outgoing dependency to ModulusGF and is involved in two incoming dependencies from ModulusGF and ErrorCorrection. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
