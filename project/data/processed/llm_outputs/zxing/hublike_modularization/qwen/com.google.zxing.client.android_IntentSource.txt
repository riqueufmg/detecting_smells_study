    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.IntentSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class IntentSource has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from CaptureActivity. Although CaptureActivity has many dependencies, the analysis must consider IntentSource in isolation. IntentSource itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
