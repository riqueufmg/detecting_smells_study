    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple classes, the number of dependencies is not excessive for typical software systems, and there are no incoming dependencies indicating other classes relying on it, which would be necessary to establish it as a hub-like component."
