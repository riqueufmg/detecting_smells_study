    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and no incoming dependencies. It interacts with multiple classes across different packages including 'com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.PDF417DetectorResult', 'com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap', 'com.google.zxing.Result', 'com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder', and others. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization as it acts as a central coordinator interacting with numerous other abstractions."
