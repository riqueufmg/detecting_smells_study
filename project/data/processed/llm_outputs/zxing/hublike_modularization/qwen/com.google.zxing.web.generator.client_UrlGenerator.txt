    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. It depends on Validators, GeneratorException, and StylesDefs classes within the same package. None of these dependencies indicate a large number of abstractions that would constitute hub-like modularization. The class does not serve as a central hub connecting to numerous other classes."
