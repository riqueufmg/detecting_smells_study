    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Version' has incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (Decoder, DataBlock, BitMatrixParser) and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes (Version.ECBlocks, FormatException). The class acts as a central point referenced by multiple other abstractions and also depends on several others, indicating hub-like behavior in its modularization."
