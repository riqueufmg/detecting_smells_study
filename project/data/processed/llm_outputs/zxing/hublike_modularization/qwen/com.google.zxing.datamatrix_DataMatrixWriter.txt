    "justification": "The class DataMatrixWriter has outgoing dependencies to 11 other abstractions, which is a large number, indicating hub-like modularization. These dependencies include classes from multiple packages such as com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder, com.google.zxing, com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder, and com.google.zxing.common. The class acts as a central point that interacts with numerous other components, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
