    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and only one incoming dependency from the Detector class. While it interacts with several abstractions, the number of dependencies is not excessively large to qualify as hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit a high degree of connectivity that would classify it as a hub."
