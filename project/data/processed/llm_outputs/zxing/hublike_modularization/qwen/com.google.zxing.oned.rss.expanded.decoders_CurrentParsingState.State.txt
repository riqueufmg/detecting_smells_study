    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.CurrentParsingState.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency from CurrentParsingState and no outgoing dependencies. The single incoming dependency represents a typical parent-child relationship where the outer class CurrentParsingState depends on its inner class State. This does not constitute hub-like modularization as there are not multiple dependencies with numerous other abstractions."
