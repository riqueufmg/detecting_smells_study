{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.BarcodeRow",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies (from PDF417 and BarcodeMatrix) and no outgoing dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
