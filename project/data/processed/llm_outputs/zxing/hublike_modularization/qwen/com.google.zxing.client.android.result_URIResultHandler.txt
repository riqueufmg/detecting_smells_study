    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple classes across different packages, the number of dependencies is not excessive enough to constitute hub-like modularization. The class does not show a pattern of being a central hub with numerous bidirectional dependencies."
