    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to CameraFacing) and is involved in incoming dependencies from three other classes (CameraConfigurationManager, CameraManager, OpenCameraInterface). This level of dependency involvement does not constitute a hub-like modularization smell as it does not show excessive or numerous dependencies characteristic of such a smell."
