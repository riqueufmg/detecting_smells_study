    "justification": "The class FormatException has no outgoing dependencies and is only depended upon by 24 other classes. While it is used across multiple packages, it acts as a simple exception class without complex coordination or control logic. It does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it neither depends on many abstractions nor coordinates interactions between them."
