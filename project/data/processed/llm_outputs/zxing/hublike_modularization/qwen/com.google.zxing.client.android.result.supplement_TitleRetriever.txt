    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to HistoryManager, URIParsedResult, and HttpHelper. The incoming dependency is from SupplementalInfoRetriever. While it has some dependencies, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it is not connecting to a large number of other abstractions relative to the CONTEXT_SIZE of 662."
