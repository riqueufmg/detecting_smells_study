    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (SymbolInfo) and 1 incoming dependency (DataMatrixWriter). The number of dependencies is relatively low, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
