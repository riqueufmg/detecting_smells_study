    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BitArray and NotFoundException) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
