    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.GenericMultipleBarcodeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes (Reader, BinaryBitmap, ResultPoint, Result, NotFoundException) and incoming dependencies from 0 classes. Considering the class in isolation and the number of outgoing dependencies, it exhibits hub-like modularization by interacting with a large number of other abstractions."
