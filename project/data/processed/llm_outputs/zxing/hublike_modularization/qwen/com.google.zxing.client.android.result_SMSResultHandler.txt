{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.SMSResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ParsedResult and SMSParsedResult) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
