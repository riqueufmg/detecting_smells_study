{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency shows that only one other class (Decoder) depends on it, and the outgoing dependencies are limited to 4 other classes. This does not indicate a large number of dependencies in either direction, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
