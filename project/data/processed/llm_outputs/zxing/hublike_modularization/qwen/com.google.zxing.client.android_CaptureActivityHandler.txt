    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivityHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CaptureActivityHandler' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include 'DecodeThread', 'Intents', 'CaptureActivityHandler.State', 'CaptureActivity', and 'CameraManager'. The incoming dependencies come from 'CaptureActivity', which itself has a large number of dependencies. This pattern indicates that 'CaptureActivityHandler' acts as a central hub connecting multiple components, thus exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
