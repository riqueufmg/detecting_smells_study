{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.Codeword",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class Codeword has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn, PDF417ScanningDecoder, DetectionResultColumn, DetectionResult) within the same package, indicating it is used by several other abstractions. Although it has no outgoing dependencies, the high number of incoming dependencies (4) suggests it acts as a central element in the module, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
