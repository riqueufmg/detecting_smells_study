    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.GeoResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ParsedResult and GeoParsedResult) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
