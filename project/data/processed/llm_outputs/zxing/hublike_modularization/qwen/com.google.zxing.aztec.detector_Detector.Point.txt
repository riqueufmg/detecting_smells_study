    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector.Point",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Detector class. The Detector class itself has multiple dependencies, but the Point class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
