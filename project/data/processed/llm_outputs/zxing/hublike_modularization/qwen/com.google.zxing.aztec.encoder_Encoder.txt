    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Encoder' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
