    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.EncodeActivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Contents, Intents, and QRCodeEncoder classes. While QRCodeEncoder itself has multiple dependencies, the EncodeActivity class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents."
