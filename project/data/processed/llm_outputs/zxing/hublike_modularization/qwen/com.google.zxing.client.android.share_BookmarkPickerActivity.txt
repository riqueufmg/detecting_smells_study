    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (1 total) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
