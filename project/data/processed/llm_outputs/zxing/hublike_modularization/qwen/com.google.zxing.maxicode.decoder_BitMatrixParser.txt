    "class": "com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder.BitMatrixParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (BitMatrix) and 1 incoming dependency (Decoder). The incoming dependency from Decoder shows 8 dependencies but this represents the Decoder class depending on multiple classes including BitMatrixParser, not multiple classes depending on BitMatrixParser. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has a limited number of dependencies."
