    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.ECIInput",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from PDF417HighLevelEncoder class. The incoming dependency references 4 classes including ECIInput itself, but this represents a limited scope of dependencies rather than a large number of abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous dependencies."
