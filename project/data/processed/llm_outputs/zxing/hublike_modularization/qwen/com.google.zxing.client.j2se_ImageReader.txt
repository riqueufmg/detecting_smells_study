    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.ImageReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ImageReader has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (DecodeWorker, GUIRunner, DecodeServlet) and is used across different packages (com.google.zxing.client.j2se and com.google.zxing.web). It is referenced in the dependencies of these external classes, indicating it has a central role with multiple incoming connections. Although it has no outgoing dependencies, the high number of incoming dependencies from various abstractions indicates hub-like behavior."
