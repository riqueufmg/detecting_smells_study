    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from PDF417ScanningDecoder shows it is used by one other class, but this does not constitute a large number of dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to ModulusGF, ChecksumException, and ModulusPoly, all within the same package except for ChecksumException. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization."
