    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryItem",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class HistoryItem has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.zxing.Result) and is depended upon by three other classes (CaptureActivity, HistoryManager, HistoryItemAdapter). This level of dependency is not excessive enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
