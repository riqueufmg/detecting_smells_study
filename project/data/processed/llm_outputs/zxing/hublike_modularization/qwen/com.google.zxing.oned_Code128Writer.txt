{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to closely related classes and enums within the same package (Code128Writer.Latch, Code128Writer.CType, Code128Writer.Charset), to a reader class (Code128Reader) that deals with the same barcode format, and to two external types (BarcodeFormat, EncodeHintType) that are part of the public API. This level of dependency is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which would require dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
