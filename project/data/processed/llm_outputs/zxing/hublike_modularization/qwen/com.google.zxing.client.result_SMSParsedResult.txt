    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMSParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to ParsedResultType) and 3 incoming dependencies (from SMSResultHandler, SMSTOMMSTOResultParser, and SMSMMSResultParser). This represents a moderate number of dependencies rather than a large number that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit excessive coupling with many other abstractions."
