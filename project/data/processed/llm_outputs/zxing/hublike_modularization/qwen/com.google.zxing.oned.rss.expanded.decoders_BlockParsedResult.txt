    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to DecodedInformation and one incoming dependency from GeneralAppIdDecoder. The number of dependencies is small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
