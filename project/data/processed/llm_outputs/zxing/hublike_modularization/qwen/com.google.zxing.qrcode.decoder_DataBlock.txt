{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DataBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DataBlock has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ErrorCorrectionLevel and Version) and 1 incoming dependency (Decoder). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
