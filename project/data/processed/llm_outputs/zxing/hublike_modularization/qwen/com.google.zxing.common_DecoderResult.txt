{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 12 different classes across multiple packages including com.google.zxing.maxicode, com.google.zxing.pdf417, com.google.zxing.qrcode, com.google.zxing.datamatrix, and com.google.zxing.aztec. This indicates it is a central abstraction that many other classes depend on for decoding results, fulfilling the criteria of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
