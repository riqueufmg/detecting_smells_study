    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (7) and only 1 incoming dependency. The dependencies are focused on core ZXing framework classes related to barcode processing, exceptions, and result handling. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
