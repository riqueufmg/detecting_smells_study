    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from PDF417ScanningDecoder contains many classes but represents a single dependent abstraction. The number of dependencies is not excessive for typical modularization patterns, and there is no evidence of hub-like behavior based on the provided dependency data."
