    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MatrixUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class MatrixUtil has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (QRCode, ByteMatrix, BitArray, MaskUtil, ErrorCorrectionLevel, Version) and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class (Encoder). It acts as a central point interacting with multiple abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, which indicates Hub-like Modularization."
