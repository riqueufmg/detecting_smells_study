    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to CaptureActivity, ParsedResult, and WifiParsedResult, which is a relatively small number and does not indicate hub-like behavior. There are no signs of excessive coupling or centralization of dependencies."
