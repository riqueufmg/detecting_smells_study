    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonDecoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReedSolomonDecoder' has incoming dependencies from 5 other classes across different packages (Decoder from maxicode, qrcode, datamatrix, aztec.detector, and aztec.decoder) and outgoing dependencies to 3 classes within the same package (GenericGF, ReedSolomonException, GenericGFPoly). This pattern of having multiple incoming dependencies from various parts of the system along with outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
