    "justification": "The class HttpHelper has outgoing dependencies to HttpHelper.ContentType and incoming dependencies from 6 different classes: URIResultInfoRetriever, BookResultInfoRetriever, ProductResultInfoRetriever, TitleRetriever, SearchBookContentsActivity, and SearchBookContentsActivity.NetworkTask. This indicates that HttpHelper acts as a hub with multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
