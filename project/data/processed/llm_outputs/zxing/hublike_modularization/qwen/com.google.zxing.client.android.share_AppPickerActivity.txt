{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share.AppPickerActivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Intents and LoadPackagesAsyncTask) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
