    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class MinimalEncoder has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions (Input, Result, HighLevelEncoder, Mode, Edge, SymbolShapeHint) and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions (DataMatrixWriter, MinimalEncoder.Result). This creates a hub-like structure where MinimalEncoder acts as a central point connecting multiple components, both consuming and being consumed by a significant number of other abstractions."
