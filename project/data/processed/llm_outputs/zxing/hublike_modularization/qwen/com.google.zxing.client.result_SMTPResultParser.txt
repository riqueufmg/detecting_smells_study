```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.SMTPResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (EmailAddressParsedResult and Result) and 0 incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
