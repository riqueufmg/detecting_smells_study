{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.GeoParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to ParsedResultType) and 2 incoming dependencies (from GeoResultHandler and GeoResultParser). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as the class is not connected to a large number of other abstractions."
