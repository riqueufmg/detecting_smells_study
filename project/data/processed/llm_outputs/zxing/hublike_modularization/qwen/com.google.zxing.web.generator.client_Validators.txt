{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.Validators",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Validators' has incoming dependencies from 5 other classes (EmailGenerator, ContactInfoGenerator, SmsAddressGenerator, PhoneNumberGenerator, UrlGenerator) and outgoing dependencies to 1 class (GeneratorException). This high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions depend on 'Validators', which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
