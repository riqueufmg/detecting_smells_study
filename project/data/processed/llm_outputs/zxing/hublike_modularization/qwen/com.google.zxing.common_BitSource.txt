    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only incoming dependencies from two DecodedBitStreamParser classes and no outgoing dependencies. While it is used by multiple parsers, the number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a single abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
