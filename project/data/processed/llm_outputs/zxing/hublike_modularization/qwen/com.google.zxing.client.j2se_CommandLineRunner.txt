    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.CommandLineRunner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CommandLineRunner has only 2 outgoing dependencies (DecoderConfig and DecodeWorker) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
