    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (PDF417Common) and 2 incoming dependencies (DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn and PDF417ScanningDecoder). This level of coupling does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it lacks a large number of dependencies either incoming or outgoing."
