    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder.Mode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from MinimalEncoder class. The incoming dependencies show that MinimalEncoder depends on this class along with other related classes (Input, Result, HighLevelEncoder, Edge, SymbolShapeHint), but this represents a normal encapsulation relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit excessive dependencies in either direction."
