{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.QRCodeMultiReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to core ZXing classes such as BinaryBitmap, BarcodeFormat, Result, and common classes like DetectorResult and DecoderResult. While it interacts with several key abstractions, the number of dependencies is not excessive for a reader class in a barcode processing library, and it does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with a large number of dependencies in both directions."
