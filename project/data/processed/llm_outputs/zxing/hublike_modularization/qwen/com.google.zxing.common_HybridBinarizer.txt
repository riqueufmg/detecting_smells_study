    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.HybridBinarizer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BitMatrix and LuminanceSource) and 0 incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
