    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Reader' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions within the system."
