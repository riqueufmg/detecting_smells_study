    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.DefaultGridSampler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (PerspectiveTransform, BitMatrix, NotFoundException) and 0 incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
