```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.book.SearchBookContentsResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (SearchBookContentsAdapter, SearchBookContentsListItem, BrowseBookListener) and no outgoing dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
