    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class QRCodeEncoder has outgoing dependencies to 10 different classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class (EncodeActivity). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with many other abstractions, suggesting hub-like behavior. Additionally, its central role in encoding QR codes implies it may accumulate more dependencies over time, reinforcing the hub-like characteristic."
