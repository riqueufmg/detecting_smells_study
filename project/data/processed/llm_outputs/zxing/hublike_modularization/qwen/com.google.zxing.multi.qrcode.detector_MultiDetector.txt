    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector.MultiDetector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class MultiDetector has outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes: FinderPatternInfo, MultiFinderPatternFinder, ResultPointCallback, DetectorResult, DecodeHintType, BitMatrix, and NotFoundException. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class interacts directly with many other abstractions."
