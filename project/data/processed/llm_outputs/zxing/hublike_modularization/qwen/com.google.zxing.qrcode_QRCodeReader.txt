    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeReader' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes, including 'com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap', 'com.google.zxing.Result', 'com.google.zxing.common.DetectorResult', 'com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix', 'com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult', 'com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Decoder', and others. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, while there are no incoming dependencies listed, the extensive outgoing dependencies alone are sufficient to classify this as a hub-like module."
