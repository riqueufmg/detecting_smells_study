    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'StylesDefs' has incoming dependencies from 10 other classes within the same package, indicating it is used by a large number of abstractions. It also has no outgoing dependencies, suggesting it serves as a central point that other classes depend on, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
