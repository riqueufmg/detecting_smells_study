    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes, including core framework classes and multiple classes within the same package and sub-packages. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
