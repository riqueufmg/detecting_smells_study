    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.MultipleBarcodeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class MultipleBarcodeReader has outgoing dependencies to 1 class (BinaryBitmap) which further connects to 5 other classes (Binarizer, BitArray, LuminanceSource, BitMatrix, NotFoundException). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 classes (DecodeWorker and DecodeServlet), each depending on multiple classes including MultipleBarcodeReader. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependency relationships indicates hub-like modularization."
