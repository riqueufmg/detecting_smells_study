```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.CharacterSetECI",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies on 1 other class (com.google.zxing.FormatException) and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes across multiple packages (ECIEncoderSet, ECIStringBuilder, PDF417HighLevelEncoder, DecodedBitStreamParser, Encoder, Decoder, HighLevelEncoder). This indicates that CharacterSetECI is centrally involved in dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, both in terms of incoming and outgoing connections, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
