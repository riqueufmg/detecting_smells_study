    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.AddressBookDoCoMoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (AddressBookParsedResult and Result) and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to the classes directly needed for parsing address book results in DoCoMo format, which is a focused responsibility. There are no signs of hub-like behavior as the class does not interact with a large number of other abstractions."
