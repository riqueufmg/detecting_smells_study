    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class WhiteRectangleDetector has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. A hub-like module would typically have a significantly higher number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, acting as a central point connecting many other modules. In this case, the dependency count is within normal limits."
