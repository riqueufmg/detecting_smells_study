    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.AmbientLightManager",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FrontLightMode and CameraManager) and 1 incoming dependency (CaptureActivity). The dependencies are limited in number and do not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
