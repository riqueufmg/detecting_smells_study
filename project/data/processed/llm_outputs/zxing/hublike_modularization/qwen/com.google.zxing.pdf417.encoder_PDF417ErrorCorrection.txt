    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417ErrorCorrection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency from PDF417 class and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependency shows PDF417 depends on 5 classes including PDF417ErrorCorrection, but this represents only one dependency relationship from one source class, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
