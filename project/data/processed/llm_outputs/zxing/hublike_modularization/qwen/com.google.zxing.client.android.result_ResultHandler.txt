{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies and 4 incoming dependencies from distinct classes. The outgoing dependencies include ParsedResult, Intents, Result, Contents, ResultParser, PreferencesActivity, and LocaleManager. The incoming dependencies come from ScanFromWebPageManager, CaptureActivity, HistoryManager, and ResultHandlerFactory. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
