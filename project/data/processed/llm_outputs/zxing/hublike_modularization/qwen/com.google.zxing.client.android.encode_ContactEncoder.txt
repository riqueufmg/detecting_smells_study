{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.ContactEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to Formatter) and 2 incoming dependencies (from VCardTelDisplayFormatter and QRCodeEncoder). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
