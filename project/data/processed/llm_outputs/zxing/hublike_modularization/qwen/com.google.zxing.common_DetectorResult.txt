    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (BitMatrix, ResultPoint) and incoming dependencies from 4 classes (MultiDetector, QRCodeMultiReader, QRCodeReader, DataMatrixReader). The class acts as a central point connecting multiple detectors and readers with the result of detection processes, showing hub-like characteristics by being a dependency for numerous other abstractions while also depending on core classes."
