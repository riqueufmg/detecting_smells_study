    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.DecodedNumeric",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (FormatException) and 1 incoming dependency (GeneralAppIdDecoder). The incoming dependency shows GeneralAppIdDecoder depends on 8 classes including DecodedNumeric, but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship, not multiple separate dependencies. The low number of direct dependencies (1 incoming, 1 outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization."
