    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its outer class Detector. The incoming dependency shows Detector depends on 9 different classes including CorrectedParameter, but this represents a normal inner class relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class itself does not exhibit excessive dependencies in either direction."
