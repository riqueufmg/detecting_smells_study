    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.AutoFocusManager.AutoFocusTask",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class AutoFocusManager. The incoming dependency shows AutoFocusManager depends on this class, but this is a normal parent-child relationship, not hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
