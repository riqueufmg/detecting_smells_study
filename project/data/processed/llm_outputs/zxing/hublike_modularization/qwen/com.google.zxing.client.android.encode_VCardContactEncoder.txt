{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.VCardContactEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (VCardFieldFormatter and Formatter) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
