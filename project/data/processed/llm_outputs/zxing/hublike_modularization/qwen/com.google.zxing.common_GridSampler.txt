{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.GridSampler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies and 3 incoming dependencies from distinct classes in different packages. The incoming dependencies come from Detector classes in qrcode, datamatrix, and aztec packages, indicating it is used as a central component across multiple modules. The outgoing dependencies to PerspectiveTransform, BitMatrix, and NotFoundException show it interacts with multiple core abstractions. This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with distinct abstractions characterizes Hub-like Modularization."
