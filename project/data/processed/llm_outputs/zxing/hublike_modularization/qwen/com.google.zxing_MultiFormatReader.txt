    "justification": "The class MultiFormatReader has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (Reader, BinaryBitmap, BarcodeFormat, Result, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException) and incoming dependencies from 2 external classes (DecodeWorker and DecodeHandler), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both internally and externally, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
