    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ReaderException has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from DecodeServlet. While DecodeServlet has many dependencies, the ReaderException itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
