    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Writer class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BarcodeFormat and WriterException) and 1 incoming dependency (MultiFormatWriter). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like structure where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
