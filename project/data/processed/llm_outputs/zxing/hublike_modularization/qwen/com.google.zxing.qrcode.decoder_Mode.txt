    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Mode' has incoming dependencies from 7 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class. The incoming dependencies originate from multiple classes in the encoder package, indicating that 'Mode' is widely used across different parts of the system. Additionally, while its outgoing dependency is only to 'Version', the high number of incoming dependencies suggests it acts as a central point of interaction, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
