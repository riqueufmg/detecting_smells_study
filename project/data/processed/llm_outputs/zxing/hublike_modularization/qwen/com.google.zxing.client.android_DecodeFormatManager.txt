    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.DecodeFormatManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 2 classes (CaptureActivity and DecodeThread) and outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (BarcodeFormat and Intents). The incoming dependency from CaptureActivity includes 22 dependencies, which indicates a large number of dependencies. Additionally, DecodeFormatManager is depended upon by multiple classes in the same package, suggesting it acts as a hub for coordination or data exchange."
