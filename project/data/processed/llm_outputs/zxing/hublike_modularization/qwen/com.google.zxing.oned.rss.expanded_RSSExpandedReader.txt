    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.RSSExpandedReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 outgoing dependencies to other classes across multiple packages, including BarcodeFormat, ResultMetadataType, RSSUtils, ResultPoint, Result, ExpandedPair, FinderPattern, BitArray, BitArrayBuilder, MathUtils, AbstractExpandedDecoder, DataCharacter, NotFoundException, and ExpandedRow. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions."
