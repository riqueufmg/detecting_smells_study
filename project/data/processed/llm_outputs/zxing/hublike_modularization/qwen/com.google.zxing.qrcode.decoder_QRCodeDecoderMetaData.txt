    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.QRCodeDecoderMetaData",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to com.google.zxing.ResultPoint and 0 incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
