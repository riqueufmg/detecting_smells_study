    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.Dimension' has no outgoing dependencies and is only used by four other classes ('DataMatrixWriter', 'EncoderContext', 'SymbolInfo', and 'HighLevelEncoder') within the same package ('com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder'). This limited scope of usage does not indicate a hub-like modularization smell."
