    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BitArray and ExpandedPair) and 1 incoming dependency (RSSExpandedReader). The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and the class does not exhibit hub-like behavior in terms of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
