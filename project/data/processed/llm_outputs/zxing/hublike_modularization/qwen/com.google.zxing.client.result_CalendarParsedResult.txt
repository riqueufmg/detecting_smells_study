    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.CalendarParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to ParsedResultType) and 2 incoming dependencies (from CalendarResultHandler and VEventResultParser). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as a hub would typically have many more dependencies in both directions."
