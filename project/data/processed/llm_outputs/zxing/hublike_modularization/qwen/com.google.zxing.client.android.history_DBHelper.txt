    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.DBHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The DBHelper class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from HistoryManager. The incoming dependency shows HistoryManager depends on 7 classes/interfaces including DBHelper, but this represents a normal dependency pattern where HistoryManager coordinates with multiple components. DBHelper itself does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
