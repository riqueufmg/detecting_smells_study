    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.CodaBarReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 6 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. While it has multiple outgoing dependencies, the number is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization. Additionally, it has only one incoming dependency from another class in the same package, indicating limited centrality in the module structure."
