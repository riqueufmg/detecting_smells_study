    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.BookmarkDoCoMoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to URIParsedResult, URIResultParser, and Result classes, which is a limited scope of interaction. There is no evidence of excessive dependencies either incoming or outgoing that would indicate hub-like modularization."
