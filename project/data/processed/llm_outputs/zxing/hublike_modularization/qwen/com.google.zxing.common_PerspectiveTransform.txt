    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.PerspectiveTransform",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.common.PerspectiveTransform' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'DefaultGridSampler', 'GridSampler', and 'Detector'. It also has outgoing dependencies listed as empty, but is involved in the dependency list of other classes. The number of incoming dependencies from different classes indicates hub-like behavior where many abstractions depend on this single class."
