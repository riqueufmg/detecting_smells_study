    "class": "com.google.zxing.integration.android.IntentResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from IntentIntegrator. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as there is no evidence of dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
