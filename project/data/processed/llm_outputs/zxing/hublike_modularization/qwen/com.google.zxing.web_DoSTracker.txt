    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to LRUMap) and 2 incoming dependencies (from DoSFilter and DecodeServlet). The total dependency count of 3 is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
