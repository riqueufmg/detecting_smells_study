{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.DecodedBitStreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include classes from both the same package and other packages (com.google.zxing.common and com.google.zxing). The incoming dependency shows that another class relies on this class among many other dependencies, indicating it acts as a hub in the modularization structure."
