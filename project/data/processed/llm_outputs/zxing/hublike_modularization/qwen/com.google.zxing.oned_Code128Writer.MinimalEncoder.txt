    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code128Writer.MinimalEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to Code128Reader and 0 incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with other abstractions does not indicate hub-like modularization, as there is no evidence of excessive coupling with a large number of other classes."
