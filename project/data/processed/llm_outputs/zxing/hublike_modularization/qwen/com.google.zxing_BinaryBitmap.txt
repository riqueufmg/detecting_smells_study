    "class": "com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap' has outgoing dependencies to 5 classes: Binarizer, BitArray, LuminanceSource, BitMatrix, and NotFoundException. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 18 classes across multiple packages including client.j2se, client.android, web, and various decoder implementations (maxicode, oned, pdf417, qrcode, datamatrix, aztec). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
