{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.Pair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The Pair class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FinderPattern and 1 incoming dependency from RSS14Reader. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
