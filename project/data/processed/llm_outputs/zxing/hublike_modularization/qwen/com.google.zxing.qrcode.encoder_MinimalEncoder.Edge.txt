```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder.Edge",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.Mode) and 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.zxing.qrcode.encoder.MinimalEncoder). The incoming dependency shows that MinimalEncoder depends on multiple classes, but this does not indicate that Edge itself has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. Edge appears to be a simple class with limited coupling."
