    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.ReedSolomonEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (GenericGF and GenericGFPoly) and 1 incoming dependency (Encoder). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
