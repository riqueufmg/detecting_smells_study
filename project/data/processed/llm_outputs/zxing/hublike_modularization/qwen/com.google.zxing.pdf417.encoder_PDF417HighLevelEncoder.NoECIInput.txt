    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from PDF417HighLevelEncoder. The incoming dependency shows that PDF417HighLevelEncoder depends on this class along with other classes (CharacterSetECI, Compaction, ECIInput), but this does not indicate hub-like behavior as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
