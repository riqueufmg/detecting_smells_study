    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.CurrentParsingState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to its inner class State and one incoming dependency from GeneralAppIdDecoder. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
