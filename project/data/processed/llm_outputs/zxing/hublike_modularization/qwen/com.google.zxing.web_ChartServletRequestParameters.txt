    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.ChartServletRequestParameters",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (ErrorCorrectionLevel) and 1 incoming dependency (ChartServlet). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
