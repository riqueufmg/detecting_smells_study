    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.EmailDoCoMoResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (EmailAddressParsedResult and Result) and 1 incoming dependency (EmailAddressResultParser). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show excessive coupling with a large number of other abstractions."
