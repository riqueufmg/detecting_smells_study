    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share.ShareActivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple classes across different packages, the number of dependencies is not excessive and does not indicate hub-like behavior. A hub-like modularization smell would typically involve a much larger number of dependencies in both directions."
