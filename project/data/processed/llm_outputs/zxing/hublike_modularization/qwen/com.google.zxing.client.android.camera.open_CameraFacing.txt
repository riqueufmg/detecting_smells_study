    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.CameraFacing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 incoming dependencies from CameraConfigurationManager, OpenCameraInterface, and OpenCamera classes, and no outgoing dependencies. This represents a low number of dependencies rather than a large number, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
