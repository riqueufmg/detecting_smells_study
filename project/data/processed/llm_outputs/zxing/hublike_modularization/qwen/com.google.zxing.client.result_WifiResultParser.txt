    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.WifiResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Result and WifiParsedResult) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are minimal and focused on related classes within the same package or direct dependencies. There are no signs of excessive dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
