    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.ProductParsedResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (ParsedResultType) and two incoming dependencies (SupplementalInfoRetriever and ProductResultParser). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not connect to a large number of other abstractions."
