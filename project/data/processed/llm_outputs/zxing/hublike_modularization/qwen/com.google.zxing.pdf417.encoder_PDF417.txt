    "justification": "The class PDF417 has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (BarcodeMatrix, BarcodeRow, PDF417ErrorCorrection, PDF417HighLevelEncoder, Compaction) and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (PDF417Writer). This creates a hub-like structure where PDF417 acts as a central coordinator with multiple dependencies, satisfying the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
