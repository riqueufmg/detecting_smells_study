    "justification": "The class 'ExpandedPair' has only 2 outgoing dependencies (DataCharacter and FinderPattern) and 2 incoming dependencies (RSSExpandedReader and BitArrayBuilder). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
