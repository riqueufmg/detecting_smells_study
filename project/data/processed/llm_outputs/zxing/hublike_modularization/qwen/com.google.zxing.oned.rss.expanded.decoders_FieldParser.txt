    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded.decoders.FieldParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from GeneralAppIdDecoder shows it is used by one other class, but this does not constitute a large number of dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited to NotFoundException and its own inner class DataLength. This level of coupling is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
