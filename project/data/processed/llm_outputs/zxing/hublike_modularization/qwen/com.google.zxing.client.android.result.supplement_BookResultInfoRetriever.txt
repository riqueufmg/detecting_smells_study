    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement.BookResultInfoRetriever",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to HistoryManager, LocaleManager, and HttpHelper, which is not a large number. The incoming dependency is from SupplementalInfoRetriever, which is within the same package. This does not indicate hub-like modularization as the number of dependencies is relatively small and there's no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous connections."
