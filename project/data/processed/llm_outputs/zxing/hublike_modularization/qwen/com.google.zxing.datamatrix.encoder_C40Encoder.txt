    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.C40Encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class C40Encoder has only 2 outgoing dependencies (EncoderContext and HighLevelEncoder) and 1 incoming dependency (HighLevelEncoder). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
