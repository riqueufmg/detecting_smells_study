    "justification": "The class GeneratorException has incoming dependencies from 11 other classes within the same package, which indicates a high number of abstractions depending on it. It acts as a central point for exception handling across multiple generator classes, creating a hub-like dependency structure where many classes rely on this single abstraction."
