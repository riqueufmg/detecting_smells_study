    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder.PDF417HighLevelEncoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies from only 2 other classes. The dependencies are focused within the same package and a closely related common package, which does not indicate a hub-like pattern where a single class would act as a central point connecting to a large number of diverse abstractions."
