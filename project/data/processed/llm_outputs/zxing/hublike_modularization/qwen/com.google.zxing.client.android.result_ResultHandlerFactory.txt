    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandlerFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResultHandlerFactory' has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: 'ParsedResult', 'Result', 'ResultParser', 'CaptureActivity', and 'ResultHandler'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'CaptureActivity', which itself depends on a large number of other classes. The class acts as a central point for creating result handlers based on parsed results, thus creating a hub-like dependency structure where many components depend on it and it depends on multiple key abstractions in the result processing flow."
