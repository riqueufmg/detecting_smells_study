    "class": "com.google.zxing.PlanarYUVLuminanceSource",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to LuminanceSource) and 1 incoming dependency (from DecodeHandler). The incoming dependency from DecodeHandler shows it depends on 6 classes, but this represents DecodeHandler's dependencies, not PlanarYUVLuminanceSource's dependencies. PlanarYUVLuminanceSource itself has minimal direct dependencies, not exhibiting hub-like characteristics with numerous incoming and outgoing connections."
