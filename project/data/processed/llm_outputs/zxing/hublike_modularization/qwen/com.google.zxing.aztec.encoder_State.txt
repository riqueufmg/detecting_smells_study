    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The State class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (BitArray, HighLevelEncoder, Token) and 1 incoming dependency (HighLevelEncoder). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
