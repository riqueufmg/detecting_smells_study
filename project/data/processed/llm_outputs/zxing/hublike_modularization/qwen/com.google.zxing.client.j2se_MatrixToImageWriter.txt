    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 2 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to BitArray, BitMatrix, and MatrixToImageConfig. The incoming dependencies come from CommandLineEncoder and ChartServlet. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization."
