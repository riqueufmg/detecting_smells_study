    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder.FormatInformation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (ErrorCorrectionLevel) and 2 incoming dependencies (Version and BitMatrixParser). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
