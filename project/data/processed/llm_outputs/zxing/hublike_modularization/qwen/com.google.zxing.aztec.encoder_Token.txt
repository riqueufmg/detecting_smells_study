{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (BitArray) and 3 incoming dependencies (SimpleToken, BinaryShiftToken, State). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
