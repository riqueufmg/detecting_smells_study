    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker' has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
