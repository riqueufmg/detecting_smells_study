    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ProductResultHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ParsedResult and Result) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to core ZXing classes that are expected for a result handler implementation. The number of dependencies is not excessive and represents normal coupling for this type of functionality."
