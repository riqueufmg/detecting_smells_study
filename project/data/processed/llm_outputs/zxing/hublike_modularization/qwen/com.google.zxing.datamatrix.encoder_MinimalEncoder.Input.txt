    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.MinimalEncoder.Input",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (SymbolShapeHint) and 1 incoming dependency (MinimalEncoder). The incoming dependency shows MinimalEncoder depends on 6 classes including this one, but that represents a single dependency relationship from MinimalEncoder to this class. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
