    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.AddressBookAUResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (AddressBookParsedResult and Result) and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are focused on related classes within the same package (com.google.zxing.client.result) and core ZXing classes. There are no indications of excessive dependencies that would suggest hub-like modularization."
