{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (PDF417ScanningDecoder), which indicates it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. The incoming dependency from PDF417ScanningDecoder shows that this class is central to the decoding process, coordinating with multiple other components such as BarcodeMetadata, Codeword, ResultPoint, BarcodeValue, PDF417Common, and BoundingBox. This central role with multiple bidirectional relationships confirms hub-like modularization."
