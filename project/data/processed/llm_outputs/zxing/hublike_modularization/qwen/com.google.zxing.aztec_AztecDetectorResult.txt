{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecDetectorResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BitMatrix and ResultPoint) and 2 incoming dependencies (AztecReader and Decoder). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have a large number of dependencies with many other abstractions."
