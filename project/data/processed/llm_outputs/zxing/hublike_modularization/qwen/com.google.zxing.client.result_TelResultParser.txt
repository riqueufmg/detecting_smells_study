{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.TelResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Result and TelParsedResult) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are minimal and focused on related classes within the same package and the core zxing package. There are no indications of excessive dependencies that would suggest hub-like modularization."
