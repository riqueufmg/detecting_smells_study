    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
