    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.oned.UPCEANReader' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 8 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by many other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
