    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (PDF417Common and ModulusPoly) and 2 incoming dependencies (ErrorCorrection and ModulusPoly). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not connect to a large number of other abstractions."
