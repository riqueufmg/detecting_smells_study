{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history.HistoryActivity",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to HistoryManager, HistoryItemAdapter, and Intents. While HistoryManager itself has several dependencies, this does not make HistoryActivity a hub since it directly depends on only 3 classes and is not depended upon by any other classes."
