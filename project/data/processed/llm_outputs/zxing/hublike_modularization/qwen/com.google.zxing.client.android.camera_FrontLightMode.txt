    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (PreferencesActivity) and 2 incoming dependencies (CameraConfigurationManager and AmbientLightManager). This represents a total of 3 dependency relationships, which is not a large number indicating hub-like modularization. The class does not show excessive connectivity with many other abstractions."
