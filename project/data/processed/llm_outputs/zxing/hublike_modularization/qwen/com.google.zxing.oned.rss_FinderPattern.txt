{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss.FinderPattern",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.oned.rss.FinderPattern' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'RSS14Reader', 'Pair', 'RSSExpandedReader', and 'ExpandedPair'. It also has outgoing dependencies to 'com.google.zxing.ResultPoint'. This creates a hub-like modularization smell as it acts as a central point connecting several other abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
