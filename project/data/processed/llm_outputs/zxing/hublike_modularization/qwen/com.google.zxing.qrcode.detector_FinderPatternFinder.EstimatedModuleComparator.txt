    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its outer class FinderPatternFinder. The incoming dependencies show that FinderPatternFinder uses this comparator class, but this represents a normal encapsulation relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit excessive dependencies in either direction."
