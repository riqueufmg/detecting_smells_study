    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecoderConfig",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 2 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to BarcodeFormat and DecodeHintType, and the incoming dependencies are from DecodeWorker and CommandLineRunner. This does not indicate hub-like modularization as the dependency count is low and manageable."
