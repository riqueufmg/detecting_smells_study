    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.ChartServlet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ChartServlet has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes across multiple packages (com.google.zxing.web, com.google.zxing, com.google.zxing.client.j2se, com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder, com.google.zxing.common, com.google.zxing), which indicates it interacts with a large number of abstractions. Additionally, it has no incoming dependencies, showing it is a central hub that depends on many other components but is not depended upon by others."
