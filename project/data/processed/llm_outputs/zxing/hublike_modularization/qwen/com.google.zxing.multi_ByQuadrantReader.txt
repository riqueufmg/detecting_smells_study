    "class": "com.google.zxing.multi.ByQuadrantReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ByQuadrantReader has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to core ZXing classes (BinaryBitmap, Reader, ResultPoint, Result) which are fundamental to its operation as a barcode reader. The number of dependencies is not excessive and represents normal coupling for a reader implementation that delegates to other core components."
