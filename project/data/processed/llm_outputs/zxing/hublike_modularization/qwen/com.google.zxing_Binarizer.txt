    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. While it does have some dependencies, the number is not excessive enough to constitute hub-like modularization given the context size of 443. The class appears to be a focused abstraction with limited but necessary dependencies for its binarization functionality."
