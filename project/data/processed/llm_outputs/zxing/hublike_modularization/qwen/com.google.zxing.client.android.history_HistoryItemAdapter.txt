    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Result and HistoryItem) and 1 incoming dependency (HistoryActivity). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show a large number of connections with other abstractions."
