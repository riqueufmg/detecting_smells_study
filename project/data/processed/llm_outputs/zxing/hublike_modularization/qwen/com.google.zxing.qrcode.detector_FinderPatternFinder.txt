{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPatternFinder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from a class that itself has 13 dependencies. The class interacts with multiple external abstractions including FinderPattern, FinderPatternInfo, ResultPoint, ResultPointCallback, EstimatedModuleComparator, DecodeHintType, BitMatrix, and NotFoundException. Additionally, it is depended upon by the Detector class which has a wide range of its own dependencies, indicating that FinderPatternFinder acts as a central hub in the module structure."
