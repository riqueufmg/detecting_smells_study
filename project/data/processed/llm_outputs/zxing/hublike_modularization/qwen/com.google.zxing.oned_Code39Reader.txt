{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Reader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. While it has multiple outgoing dependencies, the number is not excessively large relative to the context size of 592. The incoming dependencies are limited to one class (Code39Writer), which does not indicate a hub-like pattern where many classes depend on it. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
