    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder.Decoder' has outgoing dependencies to 9 distinct classes: DataBlock, DecodedBitStreamParser, ReedSolomonDecoder, ChecksumException, Version, GenericGF, BitMatrix, DecoderResult, and BitMatrixParser. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixReader'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions."
