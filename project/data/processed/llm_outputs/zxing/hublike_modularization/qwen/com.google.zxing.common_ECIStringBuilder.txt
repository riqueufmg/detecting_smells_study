{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.ECIStringBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ECIStringBuilder has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (CharacterSetECI and FormatException) and incoming dependencies from 2 classes (DecodedBitStreamParser in pdf417.decoder and DecodedBitStreamParser in datamatrix.decoder). Considering the class in isolation and based on the provided dependency data, it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which indicates Hub-like Modularization."
