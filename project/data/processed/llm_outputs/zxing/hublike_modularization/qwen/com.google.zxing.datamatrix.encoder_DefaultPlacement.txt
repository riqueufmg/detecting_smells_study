    "class": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix.encoder.DefaultPlacement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from DataMatrixWriter. The incoming dependency list shows DataMatrixWriter depends on multiple classes including DefaultPlacement, but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship, not multiple separate dependencies on DefaultPlacement itself."
