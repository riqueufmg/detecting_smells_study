    "class": "com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix' has a high number of incoming dependencies (34 classes) and outgoing dependencies (1 class). The large number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions rely on this class, while the outgoing dependency shows it interacts with at least one other abstraction. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing connections qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
