{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.Code39Writer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (BarcodeFormat and Code39Reader) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
