{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client.TimeZoneList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to TimeZoneInfo) and 1 incoming dependency (from CalendarEventGenerator). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization smell, as it does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
