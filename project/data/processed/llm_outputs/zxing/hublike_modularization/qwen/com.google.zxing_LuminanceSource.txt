    "class": "com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.LuminanceSource' has incoming dependencies from 10 other classes across multiple packages, including 'com.google.zxing.client.j2se.DecodeWorker', 'com.google.zxing.client.j2se.GUIRunner', 'com.google.zxing.web.DecodeServlet', and several others within the same package. This indicates that a large number of abstractions depend on 'LuminanceSource', which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
