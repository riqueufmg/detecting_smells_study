    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderView",

    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderView' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('com.google.zxing.ResultPoint' and 'com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.CameraManager') and incoming dependencies from 2 classes ('com.google.zxing.client.android.ViewfinderResultPointCallback' and 'com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity'). The incoming dependency from 'CaptureActivity' includes a total of 20 dependencies, indicating a high number of incoming relationships. Additionally, the outgoing dependency to 'CameraManager' leads to further 5 dependencies, increasing the overall outgoing dependency count indirectly. This pattern of having numerous both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
