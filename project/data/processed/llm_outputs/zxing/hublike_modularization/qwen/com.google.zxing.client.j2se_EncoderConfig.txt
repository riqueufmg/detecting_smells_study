    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to BarcodeFormat) and 1 incoming dependency (from CommandLineEncoder). The incoming dependency contains 4 dependencies but this represents a single source of incoming dependencies, not multiple abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous dependencies in both directions."
