    "class": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.Detector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.Detector' has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct classes ('com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap', 'com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix', 'com.google.zxing.ResultPoint', 'com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector.PDF417DetectorResult') and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader') which itself depends on 12 different classes including the Detector. This indicates that the Detector acts as a hub connecting multiple components, both consuming and being consumed by a wide range of other abstractions."
