```json
{
    "class": "com.google.zxing.oned.OneDReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.oned.OneDReader' has outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes: BinaryBitmap, ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint, Result, DecodeHintType, BitArray, and NotFoundException. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (MultiFormatOneDReader), which also depends on multiple classes including OneDReader. This pattern of having both numerous outgoing and incoming dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
