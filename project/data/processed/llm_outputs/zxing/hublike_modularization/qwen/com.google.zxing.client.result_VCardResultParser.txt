    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.result.VCardResultParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (AddressBookParsedResult and Result) and 1 incoming dependency (VEventResultParser). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
