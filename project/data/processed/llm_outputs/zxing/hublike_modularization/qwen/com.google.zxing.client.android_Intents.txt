    "class": "com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents' has incoming dependencies from 13 different classes across multiple packages, indicating it is referenced by a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has no outgoing dependencies, making it a central point that other classes depend on without itself depending on many others, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
