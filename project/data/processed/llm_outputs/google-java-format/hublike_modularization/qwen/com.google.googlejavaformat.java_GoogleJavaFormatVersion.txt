    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.GoogleJavaFormatVersion",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Main class. The Main class depends on 5 classes in total, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for GoogleJavaFormatVersion specifically since it only has minimal dependency relationships."
