    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.InputOutput",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Input and Newlines) and 1 incoming dependency from JavaOutput. While it has some dependencies, the number is not excessively large to qualify as hub-like modularization. The class does not show a pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions that would characterize a hub-like structure."
