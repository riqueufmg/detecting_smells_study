    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.TypeNameClassifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to its inner class TyParseState and one incoming dependency from JavaInputAstVisitor. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
