    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Indent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.googlejavaformat.Indent' has incoming dependencies from 9 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('com.google.googlejavaformat.Indent.Const'). The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
