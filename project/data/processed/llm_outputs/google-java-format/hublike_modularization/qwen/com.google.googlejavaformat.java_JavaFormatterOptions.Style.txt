    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterOptions.Style",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from JavaFormatterOptions class. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as there are not dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
