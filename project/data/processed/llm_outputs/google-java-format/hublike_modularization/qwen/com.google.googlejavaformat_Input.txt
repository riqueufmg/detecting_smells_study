    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Input",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.googlejavaformat.Input' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes and incoming dependencies from 15 classes. This high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions depend on it, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
