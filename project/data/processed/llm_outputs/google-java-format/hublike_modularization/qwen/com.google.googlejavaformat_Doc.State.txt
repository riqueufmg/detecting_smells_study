{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its outer class Doc, which is typical for inner classes. The incoming dependencies list shows the outer class Doc depends on multiple abstractions, but this does not indicate the State class itself has hub-like modularization since it has no dependencies itself."
