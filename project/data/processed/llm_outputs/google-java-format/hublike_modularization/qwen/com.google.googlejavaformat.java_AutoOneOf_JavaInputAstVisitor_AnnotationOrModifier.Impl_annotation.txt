    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'JavaInputAstVisitor' and no incoming dependencies. Although the dependent class itself has many outgoing dependencies, the analyzed class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor does it have a high number of incoming dependencies."
