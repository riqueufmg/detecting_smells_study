    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'JavaInputAstVisitor', which itself lists 20 dependencies. However, the class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, nor does it have a large number of incoming dependencies from multiple sources."
