    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavadocWriter has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions (JavadocFormatter, JavadocWriter.AutoIndent, Token, JavadocWriter.RequestedWhitespace, NestingCounter) and incoming dependencies from 1 abstraction (JavadocFormatter). The class JavadocFormatter also depends on JavadocWriter and shares dependencies with it, creating a hub-like relationship where JavadocWriter is central to multiple dependencies."
