{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc.FillMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Doc class, which is its enclosing class. The incoming dependencies show that Doc class depends on multiple classes including FillMode itself, but this represents a normal parent-child relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
