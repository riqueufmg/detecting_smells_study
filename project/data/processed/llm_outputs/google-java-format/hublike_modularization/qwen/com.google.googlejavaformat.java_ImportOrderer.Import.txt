    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class ImportOrderer. The incoming dependency shows ImportOrderer depends on 7 classes including this one, but this represents a normal parent-child relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class itself does not exhibit excessive dependencies in either direction."
