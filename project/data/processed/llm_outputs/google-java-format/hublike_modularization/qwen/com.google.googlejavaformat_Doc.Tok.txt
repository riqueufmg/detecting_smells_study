    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.google.googlejavaformat.Input) and 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc). The total dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
