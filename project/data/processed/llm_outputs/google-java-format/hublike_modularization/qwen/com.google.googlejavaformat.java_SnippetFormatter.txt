    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SnippetFormatter has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and only one incoming dependency from JavaFormatterBase. While it interacts with several core classes like Formatter, JavaFormatterOptions, and FormatterException, the dependency count is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization. Additionally, many of its dependencies are closely related nested or inner classes (SnippetWrapper, SnippetKind) which are part of its own encapsulation scope, reducing the smell indicator."
