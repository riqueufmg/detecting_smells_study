    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ImportOrderer.ImportType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ImportOrderer, which is its enclosing class. The incoming dependency shows ImportOrderer uses this class along with several other related classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
