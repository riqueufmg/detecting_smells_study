    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.FormatterException",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FormatterException has incoming dependencies from 9 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class (FormatterDiagnostic). The high number of incoming dependencies (9) indicates that many abstractions depend on FormatterException, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it depends on another abstraction (FormatterDiagnostic), contributing to its hub-like behavior in the modularization structure."
