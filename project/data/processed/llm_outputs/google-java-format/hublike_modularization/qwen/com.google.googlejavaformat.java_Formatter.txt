    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Formatter class has 14 outgoing dependencies and 9 incoming dependencies from various classes, indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of dependencies it uses and dependencies that rely on it. This high number of bidirectional dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
