    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Trees",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Trees' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'Formatter', 'JavaInputAstVisitor', 'StringWrapper', and 'RemoveUnusedImports'. It also appears in the outgoing dependencies of these classes, indicating bidirectional dependencies. This pattern of having both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
