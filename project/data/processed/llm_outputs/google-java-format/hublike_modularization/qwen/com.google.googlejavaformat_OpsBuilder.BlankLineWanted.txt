{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.OpsBuilder.BlankLineWanted",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class OpsBuilder. The incoming dependency shows OpsBuilder depends on 9 classes including BlankLineWanted, but this represents a single dependency relationship from one class, not multiple dependencies from many different abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has minimal dependencies."
