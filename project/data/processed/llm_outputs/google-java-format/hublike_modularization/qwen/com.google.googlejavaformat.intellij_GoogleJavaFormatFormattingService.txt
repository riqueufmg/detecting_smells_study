    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 0 classes. While the incoming dependencies are low, the outgoing dependencies are relatively high, connecting to multiple distinct abstractions across different packages, which indicates hub-like behavior in terms of outgoing connections."
