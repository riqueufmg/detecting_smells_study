    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class JavadocFormatter has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (2). It interacts with JavadocWriter, Token, and JavadocLexer as outgoing dependencies, and is depended upon by JavaCommentsHelper and JavadocWriter as incoming dependencies. The dependency count is not excessively high, and the interactions are confined to closely related classes within the same package, indicating modular and cohesive design rather than hub-like modularization."
