    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoValue_JavaFormatterOptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to JavaFormatterOptions and one incoming dependency from JavaFormatterOptions. The low number of dependencies (only 1 each direction) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
