    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (JavaFormatterOptions) and 1 incoming dependency (GoogleJavaFormatSettings). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
