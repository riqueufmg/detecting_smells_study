{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc.Space",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class Doc. The incoming dependency shows Doc depends on 10 abstractions including Doc.Space, but this represents a normal parent-child relationship rather than hub-like modularization. Doc.Space appears to be a nested class with minimal dependencies, not acting as a hub that connects to many other abstractions."
