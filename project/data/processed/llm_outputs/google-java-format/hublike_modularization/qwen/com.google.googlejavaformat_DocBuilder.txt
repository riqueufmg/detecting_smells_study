    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.DocBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'DocBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('Doc' and 'Indent') and incoming dependencies from 4 classes ('Formatter', 'OpenOp', 'CloseOp', 'Op'). The outgoing dependency to 'Doc' involves 10 additional dependencies, indicating a high number of outgoing connections. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple other abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
