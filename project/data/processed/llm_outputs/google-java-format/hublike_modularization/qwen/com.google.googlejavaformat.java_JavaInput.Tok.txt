    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.google.googlejavaformat.Input) and 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInput). The total number of dependencies is small, indicating limited connectivity rather than hub-like modularization where there would be dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
