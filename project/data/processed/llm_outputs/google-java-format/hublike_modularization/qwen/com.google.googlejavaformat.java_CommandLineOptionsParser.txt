    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.CommandLineOptionsParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to Builder) and 1 incoming dependency (from Main). The incoming dependency from Main shows Main depends on 5 classes including CommandLineOptionsParser, but this represents Main's dependencies, not CommandLineOptionsParser's hub-like behavior. CommandLineOptionsParser itself has minimal dependencies in both directions, not exhibiting hub-like modularization where a single class would have many dependencies in both incoming and outgoing directions."
