{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavacTokens",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (CommentSavingTokenizer and AccessibleScanner) and 1 incoming dependency from JavaInput. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
