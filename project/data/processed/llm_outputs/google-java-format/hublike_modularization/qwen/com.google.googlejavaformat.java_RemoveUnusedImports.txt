{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes, indicating it is connected to a large number of abstractions both ways. Specifically, it depends on classes like Trees, UnusedImportScanner, DocTreeScanner, FormatterException, and Newlines, while being depended upon by Formatter, FormatFileCallable, and GoogleJavaFormatImportOptimizer, which themselves depend on multiple other classes, increasing the overall connectivity and making RemoveUnusedImports a hub in the modularization structure."
