    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.StringWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class StringWrapper has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 2 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies. It does not act as a hub connecting to many other abstractions. The dependencies are limited to FormatterException, Trees, Formatter, and Newlines for outgoing, and Formatter and FormatFileCallable for incoming, indicating a relatively low coupling."
