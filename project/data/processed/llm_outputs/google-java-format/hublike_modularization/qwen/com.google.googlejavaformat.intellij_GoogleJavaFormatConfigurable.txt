    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.GoogleJavaFormatConfigurable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (UiFormatterStyle and GoogleJavaFormatSettings) and no incoming dependencies. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
