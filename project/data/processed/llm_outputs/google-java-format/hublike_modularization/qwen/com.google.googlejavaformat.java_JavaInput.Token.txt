    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.google.googlejavaformat.Input' and one incoming dependency from 'com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInput'. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a large number of abstractions would be involved."
