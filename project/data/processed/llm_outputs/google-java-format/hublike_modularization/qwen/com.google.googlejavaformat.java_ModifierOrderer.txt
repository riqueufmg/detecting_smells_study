    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.ModifierOrderer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from Formatter shows it is used by one other class, and it does not show excessive dependencies to a large number of other abstractions. The dependency count is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
