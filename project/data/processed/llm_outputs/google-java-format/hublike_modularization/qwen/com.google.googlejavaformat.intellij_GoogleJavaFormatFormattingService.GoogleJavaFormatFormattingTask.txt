    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'Notifications' and 'Formatter'. While 'Formatter' has many dependencies, this does not make the analyzed class itself hub-like since it only depends on a few abstractions directly."
