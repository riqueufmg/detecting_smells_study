    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
