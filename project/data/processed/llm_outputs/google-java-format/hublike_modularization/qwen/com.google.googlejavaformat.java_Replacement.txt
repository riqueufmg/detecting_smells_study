    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Replacement' has no outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies from classes 'JavaFormatterBase', 'SnippetFormatter', and 'JavaOutput'. This does not indicate a large number of dependencies that would classify it as hub-like modularization."
