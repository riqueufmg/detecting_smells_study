    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.FormatFileCallable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FormatFileCallable has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes (RemoveUnusedImports, StringWrapper, FormatterException, FormatFileCallable.Result, JavaFormatterOptions, Formatter, ImportOrderer) and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes (Main, AutoValue_FormatFileCallable_Result). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions in the system."
