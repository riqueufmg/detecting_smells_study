{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Doc.RealOrImaginary",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class Doc, which is expected for inner classes. The incoming dependency shows Doc depending on 10 other abstractions, but this represents Doc's dependencies, not Doc.RealOrImaginary's. The class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependencies."
