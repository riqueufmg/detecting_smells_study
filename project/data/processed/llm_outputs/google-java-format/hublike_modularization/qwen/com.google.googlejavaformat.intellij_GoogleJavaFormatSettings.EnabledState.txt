{
    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij.GoogleJavaFormatSettings.EnabledState",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from GoogleJavaFormatSettings class. The incoming dependency shows that GoogleJavaFormatSettings depends on EnabledState along with three other classes (JavaFormatterOptions, JreConfigurationChecker, and State), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the EnabledState class itself has minimal dependencies and is not acting as a hub connecting to many other abstractions."
