    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.RemoveUnusedImports.DocTreeScanner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class RemoveUnusedImports. The incoming dependency list shows only one class with multiple dependencies, but this represents a typical parent-child relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
