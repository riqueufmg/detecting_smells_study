    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaFormatterBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to JavaFormatterOptions, Replacement, and SnippetFormatter, which is not a large number of dependencies. There are no incoming dependencies indicating other classes do not depend on this class. This does not constitute hub-like modularization as the dependency count is low and there is no central dependency hub pattern present."
