    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.JavaInputAstVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaInputAstVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 6 abstractions. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions between numerous other components, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
