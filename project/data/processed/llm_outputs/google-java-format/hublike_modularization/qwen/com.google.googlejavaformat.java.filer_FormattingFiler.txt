    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.filer.FormattingFiler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to Formatter and 0 incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling, not indicating hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
