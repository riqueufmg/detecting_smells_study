    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.DimensionHelpers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from JavaInputAstVisitor shows a single class depending on it, and the outgoing dependencies are to inner classes, which is typical for helper or utility classes and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
