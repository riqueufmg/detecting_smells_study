    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.OpenOp",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class OpenOp has only 3 outgoing dependencies (Op, DocBuilder, Indent) and 2 incoming dependencies (JavaInputAstVisitor, OpsBuilder). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
