    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.OpsBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'OpsBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'OpsBuilder' acts as a central hub connecting multiple abstractions within the system, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
