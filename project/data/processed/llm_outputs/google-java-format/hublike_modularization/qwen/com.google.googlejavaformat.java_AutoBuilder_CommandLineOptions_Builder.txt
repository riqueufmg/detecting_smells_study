    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.AutoBuilder_CommandLineOptions_Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Builder' and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
