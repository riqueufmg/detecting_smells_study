    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Output' has incoming dependencies from 'Doc' and 'OpsBuilder', and outgoing dependencies to 'Input' and 'CommentsHelper'. The incoming dependency from 'Doc' includes 10 dependencies, and from 'OpsBuilder' includes 9 dependencies. The outgoing dependencies include 2 direct dependencies, with 'Input' having further 2 dependencies and 'CommentsHelper' having 1 dependency. This creates a hub-like structure where 'Output' is central to multiple interactions."
