    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.FormatterDiagnostic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only incoming dependencies from 4 other classes and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies are from FormatterException, Input, OpsBuilder, and FormattingError. Since there are no outgoing dependencies and the number of incoming dependencies is relatively low, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
