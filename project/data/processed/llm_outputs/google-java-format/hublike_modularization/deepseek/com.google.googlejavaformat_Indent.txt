    "class": "com.google.googlejavaformat.Indent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (9 distinct classes: JavaInputAstVisitor, Doc, Doc.Level, Doc.Token, Doc.Break, Indent.If, OpenOp, DocBuilder, OpsBuilder). It also has outgoing dependencies (1 class: Indent.Const). The large number of incoming dependencies indicates it is a central hub used by many other abstractions."
