    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (13 distinct classes depend on it), including FilenameUtils, FileAlterationObserver, PathFileComparator, ExtensionFileComparator, NameFileComparator, SuffixFileFilter, FileFilterUtils, WildcardFileFilter, PrefixFileFilter, RegexFileFilter, and NameFileFilter. This large number of dependent abstractions indicates it acts as a central hub."
