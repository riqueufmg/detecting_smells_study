    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (Uncheck, Constants, IOConsumer, IOSupplier) and incoming dependencies from 10 other abstractions (RandomAccessFileMode, IOTriFunction, Constants, Uncheck, IOStream, IOBiFunction, Erase, IOQuadFunction, PathUtils, ThresholdingOutputStream). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
