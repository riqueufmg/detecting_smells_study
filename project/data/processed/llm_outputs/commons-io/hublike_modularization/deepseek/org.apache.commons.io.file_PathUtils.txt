    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 outgoing dependencies and 13 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 30 dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
