    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero outgoing dependencies and six incoming dependencies. While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the total number of distinct dependency relationships (incoming + outgoing) is six, which is not considered a large number indicative of a hub. The class acts as a common utility for exceptions but does not exhibit extensive coupling in both directions."
