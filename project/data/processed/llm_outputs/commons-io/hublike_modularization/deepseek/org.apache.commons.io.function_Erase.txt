    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions (IOPredicate, IORunnable, IOBiFunction, IOSupplier, IOBiConsumer, IOConsumer, IOFunction, IOComparator) and incoming dependencies from 7 other abstractions (IOStreams, IOBaseStream, IOStream, BrokenReader, BrokenInputStream, BrokenWriter, BrokenOutputStream). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
