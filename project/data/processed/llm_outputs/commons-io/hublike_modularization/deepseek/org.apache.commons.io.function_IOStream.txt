    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes (IOPredicate, IOUnaryOperator, IOBiFunction, IOExceptionList, IOSupplier, Erase, IOStreamAdapter, IOBiConsumer, IOConsumer, IOBinaryOperator, IOFunction, IOStreams, IOComparator) and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes (IOStreams, IOStreamAdapter). The total number of distinct dependent abstractions is 15, indicating a hub-like modularization."
