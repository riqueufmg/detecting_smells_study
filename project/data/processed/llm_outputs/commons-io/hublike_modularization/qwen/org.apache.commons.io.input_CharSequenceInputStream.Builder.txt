    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from CharSequenceInputStream. The incoming dependency references multiple classes but this represents a single dependency relationship, not a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
