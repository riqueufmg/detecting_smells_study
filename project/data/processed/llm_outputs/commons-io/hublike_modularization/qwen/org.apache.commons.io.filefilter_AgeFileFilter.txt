    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AgeFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FileUtils and no incoming dependencies. While FileUtils itself has many dependencies (16), the AgeFileFilter class in isolation only depends on a single class, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
