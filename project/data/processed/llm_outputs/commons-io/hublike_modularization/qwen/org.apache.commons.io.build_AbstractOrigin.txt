{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractOrigin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 3 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to RandomAccessFileMode and Charsets, and the incoming dependencies are from LockableFileWriter, LockableFileWriter.Builder, and AbstractOriginSupplier. This does not indicate hub-like modularization as the dependency count is relatively low and focused."
