```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.CanReadFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (CanWriteFileFilter and IOFileFilter) and 0 incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
