    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.LockableFileWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class LockableFileWriter has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, especially considering the class seems to be a specialized utility for file writing with locking mechanism."
