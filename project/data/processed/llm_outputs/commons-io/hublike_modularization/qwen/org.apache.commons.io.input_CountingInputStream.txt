    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CountingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to ProxyInputStream and no incoming dependencies. The dependency graph shows limited connections, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
