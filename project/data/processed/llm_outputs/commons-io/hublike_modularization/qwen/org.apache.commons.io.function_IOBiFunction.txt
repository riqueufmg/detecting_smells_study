    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiFunction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class IOBiFunction has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (Uncheck, IOFunction) and incoming dependencies from 9 classes (Constants, Uncheck, IOStream, Erase, SimplePathVisitor, SimplePathVisitor.AbstractBuilder, NoopPathVisitor, CountingPathVisitor, AccumulatorPathVisitor). The number of incoming dependencies is significantly high, indicating that many other abstractions depend on it. Additionally, it appears in the dependencies of multiple classes across different packages, suggesting centralization of interactions through this class, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
