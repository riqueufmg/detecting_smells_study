    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.function.IOSupplier' has incoming dependencies from 6 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck'), which in turn depends on 15 other classes. This creates a hub-like dependency structure where 'IOSupplier' is central to a large number of dependencies, both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
