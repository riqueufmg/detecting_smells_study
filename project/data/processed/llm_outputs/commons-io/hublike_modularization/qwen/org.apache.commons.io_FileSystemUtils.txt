{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileSystemUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FileUtils and 0 incoming dependencies. While FileUtils itself has many dependencies (16 outgoing), the FileSystemUtils class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
