    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to IOUtils and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency to IOUtils shows a single connection, which does not indicate hub-like behavior. A hub-like modularization would require dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not present here."
