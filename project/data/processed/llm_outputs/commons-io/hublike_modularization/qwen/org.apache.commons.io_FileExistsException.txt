```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileExistsException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from FileUtils class. The incoming dependency shows that FileUtils depends on FileExistsException along with many other classes, but this does not indicate that FileExistsException itself has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. FileExistsException appears to be a simple exception class with minimal coupling."
