    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.AbstractByteArrayOutputStream.InputStreamConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class AbstractByteArrayOutputStream. The incoming dependency shows the enclosing class uses this inner class, but this does not constitute hub-like modularization as the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
