    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Constants",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Constants' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Constants' acts as a hub within the module, connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
