    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.CharSequenceInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to classes within the same package and to utility classes in the org.apache.commons.io package. None of the dependencies indicate a large number of interactions that would suggest hub-like modularization."
