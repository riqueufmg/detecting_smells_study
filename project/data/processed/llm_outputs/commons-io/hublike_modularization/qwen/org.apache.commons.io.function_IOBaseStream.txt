    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBaseStream' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes: 'IORunnable', 'Erase', 'IOIterator', and 'IOSpliterator'. Among these, 'Erase' has further dependencies to 8 other classes, indicating it acts as a hub. Additionally, 'IOBaseStream' connects to multiple abstractions directly and indirectly, contributing to a hub-like structure where it centrally interacts with a large number of other abstractions."
