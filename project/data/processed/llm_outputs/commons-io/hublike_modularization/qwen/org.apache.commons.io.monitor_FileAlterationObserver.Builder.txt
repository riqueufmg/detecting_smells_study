    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FileEntry and IOCase) and 1 incoming dependency (FileAlterationObserver). The total dependency count of 3 is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which would require dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
