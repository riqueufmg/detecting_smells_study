{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.DirectoryStreamFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DirectoryStreamFilter has only 2 outgoing dependencies (PathFilter and PathUtils) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are limited in number and do not indicate a large number of connections. PathUtils does have many dependencies but that is not attributed to DirectoryStreamFilter directly. DirectoryStreamFilter does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
