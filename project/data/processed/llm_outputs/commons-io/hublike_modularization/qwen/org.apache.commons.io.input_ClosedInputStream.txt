    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ClosedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (IOUtils) and three incoming dependencies (CloseShieldInputStream, AutoCloseInputStream, AbstractByteArrayOutputStream). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not connect to a large number of other abstractions."
