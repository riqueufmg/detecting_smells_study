    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.IOFileFilter' has incoming dependencies from 17 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 other class, making it a central hub in the module. This high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions depend on it, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
