{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.XmlStreamWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class XmlStreamWriter has outgoing dependencies to 3 different classes: IOUtils, XmlStreamReader, and XmlStreamWriter.Builder. The dependency to IOUtils leads to 16 additional transitive dependencies, and the dependency to XmlStreamReader leads to 5 additional transitive dependencies. This results in a total of 24 outgoing dependencies (3 direct + 16 from IOUtils + 5 from XmlStreamReader). Although there are no incoming dependencies, the large number of outgoing dependencies (24) indicates hub-like modularization."
