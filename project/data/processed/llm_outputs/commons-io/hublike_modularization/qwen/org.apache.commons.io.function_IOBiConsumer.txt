{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiConsumer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBiConsumer' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('Uncheck', 'Constants') and incoming dependencies from 5 classes ('Constants', 'Uncheck', 'IOStream', 'Erase', 'BoundedInputStream'). This indicates that the class interacts with a relatively large number of other abstractions within the system, both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
