{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReaderException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from XmlStreamReader class. The incoming dependencies list shows XmlStreamReader depends on 5 classes including XmlStreamReaderException, but this represents a single dependency relationship from one source class, not multiple different abstractions depending on XmlStreamReaderException. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous dependencies."
