{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator.LastModifiedFileComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils and no incoming dependencies. While FileUtils itself has many dependencies (16), the LastModifiedFileComparator does not directly depend on those classes, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization with a large number of direct dependencies."
