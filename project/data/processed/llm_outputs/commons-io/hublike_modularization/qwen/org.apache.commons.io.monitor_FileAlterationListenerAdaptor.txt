    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FileAlterationObserver and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency FileAlterationObserver itself has 7 dependencies, but this does not make FileAlterationListenerAdaptor a hub. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions - it only interacts with one other class directly."
