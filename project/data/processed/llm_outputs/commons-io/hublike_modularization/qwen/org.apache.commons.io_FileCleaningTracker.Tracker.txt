    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker.Tracker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (FileDeleteStrategy) and 0 incoming dependencies, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction. A hub-like modularization smell requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, but this class shows minimal dependency relationships."
