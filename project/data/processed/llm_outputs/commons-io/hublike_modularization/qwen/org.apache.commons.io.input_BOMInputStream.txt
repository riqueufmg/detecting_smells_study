    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BOMInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BOMInputStream has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to BOMInputStream.Builder, ByteOrderMark, and IOUtils. The incoming dependency is from XmlStreamReader. This is not a large number of dependencies, and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
