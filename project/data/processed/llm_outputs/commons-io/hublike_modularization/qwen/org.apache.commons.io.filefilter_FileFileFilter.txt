    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.FileFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (IOFileFilter) and is depended upon by two other classes (FileUtils and FileFilterUtils), each of which depends on multiple other classes. While it has some incoming dependencies, the number is not excessively large relative to the system context implied by the dependencies listed. Hub-like Modularization typically involves a significantly larger number of dependencies in both directions."
