    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to IOUtils and no incoming dependencies. While IOUtils itself has many dependencies (16 outgoing dependencies), the ChunkedWriter class in isolation only depends on one other class, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
