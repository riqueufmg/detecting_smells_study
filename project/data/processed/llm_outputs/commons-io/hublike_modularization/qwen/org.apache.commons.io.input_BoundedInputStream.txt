    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BoundedInputStream has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from IOUtils. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
