{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOPredicate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class IOPredicate has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (Uncheck and Constants) and incoming dependencies from 4 classes (Constants, Uncheck, IOStream, Erase). Additionally, it appears in the dependency lists of multiple other classes both in outgoing and incoming directions, indicating it is involved in numerous interactions. This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with various other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
