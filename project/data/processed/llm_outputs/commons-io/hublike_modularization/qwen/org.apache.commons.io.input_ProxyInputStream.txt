    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (IOUtils, IOIntConsumer, Input, ProxyInputStream.AbstractBuilder) and incoming dependencies from 5 other abstractions (ObservableInputStream, ObservableInputStream.AbstractBuilder, BoundedInputStream, BoundedInputStream.AbstractBuilder, CountingInputStream). This creates a hub-like structure where ProxyInputStream is central to multiple dependencies both incoming and outgoing, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
