{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Erase' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes (IOConsumer, IOPredicate, IOBiFunction, IOSupplier, IORunnable, IOBiConsumer, IOComparator, IOFunction) and incoming dependencies from 7 classes (IOStreams, IOBaseStream, IOStream, BrokenReader, BrokenInputStream, BrokenWriter, BrokenOutputStream). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
