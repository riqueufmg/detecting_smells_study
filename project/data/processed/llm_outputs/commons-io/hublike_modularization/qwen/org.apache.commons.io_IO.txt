{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IO",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class IO has only 1 outgoing dependency to IOUtils and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency IOUtils itself has multiple dependencies but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the IO class. Hub-like modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
