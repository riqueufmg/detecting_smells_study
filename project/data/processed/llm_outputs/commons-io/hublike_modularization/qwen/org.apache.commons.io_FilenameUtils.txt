    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FilenameUtils has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (FileSystem, IOCase) and incoming dependencies from 7 classes (FileSystem, FileUtils, PathUtils, ExtensionFileComparator, WildcardClassNameMatcher, WildcardFileFilter, WildcardFilter). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as FilenameUtils acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions."
