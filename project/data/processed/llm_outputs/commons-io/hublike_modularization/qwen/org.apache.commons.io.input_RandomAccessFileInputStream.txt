{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.RandomAccessFileInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to IOUtils and its own inner class Builder. While IOUtils itself has many dependencies, the RandomAccessFileInputStream does not directly depend on those, thus it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
