{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to IOUtils and its inner class Builder. Although IOUtils itself has many dependencies, the UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream class does not directly depend on those classes, thus it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
