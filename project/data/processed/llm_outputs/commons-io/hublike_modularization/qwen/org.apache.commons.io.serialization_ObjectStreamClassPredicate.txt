{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ObjectStreamClassPredicate",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (ClassNameMatcher) and 2 incoming dependencies (ValidatingObjectInputStream and ValidatingObjectInputStream.Builder). The number of dependencies is relatively small, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
