    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.QueueOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (QueueInputStream) and one incoming dependency (QueueInputStream). The definition of Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, but this class only interacts with a single other class, which does not constitute 'a large number' of dependencies."
