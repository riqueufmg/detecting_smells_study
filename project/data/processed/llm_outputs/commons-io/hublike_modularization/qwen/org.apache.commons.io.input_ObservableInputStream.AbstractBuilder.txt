    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream.AbstractBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (ProxyInputStream) and one incoming dependency (ObservableInputStream). The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
