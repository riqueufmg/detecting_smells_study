{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.CopyDirectoryVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (PathFilter and PathUtils) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are within the same package. While PathUtils has many dependencies, this does not make CopyDirectoryVisitor a hub since we analyze the class in isolation and it does not have a large number of direct dependencies itself."
