{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterator' has incoming dependencies from 4 classes (IOBaseStream, UncheckedIOIterator, IOIterable, ReversedLinesFileReader) and outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (IOConsumer, IOIteratorAdapter). This creates a hub-like dependency pattern where the class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both upstream and downstream."
