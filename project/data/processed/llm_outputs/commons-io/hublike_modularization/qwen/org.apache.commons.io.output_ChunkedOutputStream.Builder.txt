{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ChunkedOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ChunkedOutputStream within the same package. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
