{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.StandardDeleteOption",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 4 other classes (FileUtils, DeletingPathVisitor, CleaningPathVisitor, PathUtils) and is listed as a dependency in multiple key utility classes within the same package and across packages, indicating it acts as a central point for delete operations. Despite having no outgoing dependencies, the significant number of incoming dependencies from diverse classes confirms hub-like modularization."
