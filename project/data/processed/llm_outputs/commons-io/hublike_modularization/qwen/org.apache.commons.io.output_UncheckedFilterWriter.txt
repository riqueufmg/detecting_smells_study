    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UncheckedFilterWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to UncheckedFilterWriter.Builder and Uncheck. While Uncheck has many dependencies, the UncheckedFilterWriter itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
