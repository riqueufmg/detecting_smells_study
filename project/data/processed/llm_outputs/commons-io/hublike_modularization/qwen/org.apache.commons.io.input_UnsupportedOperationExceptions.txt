    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only receives incoming dependencies from 6 other classes within the same package. While it is used by multiple classes, the number of dependencies is not excessive relative to the context size of 520, and it does not exhibit hub-like behavior with a large number of dependencies in both directions."
