    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (IOFileFilter) and 1 incoming dependency (FileFilterUtils). The incoming dependency from FileFilterUtils shows it depends on 8 classes, but this represents FileFilterUtils's dependencies, not DirectoryFileFilter's incoming dependencies. DirectoryFileFilter itself has minimal dependencies both incoming and outgoing, not exhibiting hub-like characteristics."
