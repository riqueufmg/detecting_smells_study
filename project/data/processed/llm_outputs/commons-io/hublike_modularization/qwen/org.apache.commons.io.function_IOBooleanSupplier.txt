    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOBooleanSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'IOBooleanSupplier' has only one outgoing dependency to 'Uncheck' and one incoming dependency from 'Uncheck'. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies with many other abstractions."
