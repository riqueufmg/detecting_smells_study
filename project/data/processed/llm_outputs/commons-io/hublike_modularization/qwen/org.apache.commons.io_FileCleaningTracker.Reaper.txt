    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker.Reaper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency from FileCleaningTracker and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependency involves only two classes (Reaper itself and FileDeleteStrategy), which is not a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
