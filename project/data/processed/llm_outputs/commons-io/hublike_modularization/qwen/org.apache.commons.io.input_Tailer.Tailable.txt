    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.Tailable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from Tailer class. The incoming dependency shows Tailer depends on Tailable but this represents a single dependency relationship, not a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
