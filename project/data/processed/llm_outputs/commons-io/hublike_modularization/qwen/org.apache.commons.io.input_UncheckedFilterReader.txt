    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UncheckedFilterReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Uncheck and UncheckedFilterReader.Builder. Although Uncheck itself has many dependencies, the UncheckedFilterReader class does not directly depend on those. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
