    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.ThreadUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.ThreadUtils' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes across different packages, including 'org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer', 'org.apache.commons.io.file.PathUtils', and 'org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationMonitor'. This indicates that ThreadUtils is being used by a large number of other abstractions, creating a hub-like dependency pattern where it serves as a central point for thread-related utilities. Additionally, it has no outgoing dependencies, which further emphasizes its role as a centralized utility with high incoming dependency count."
