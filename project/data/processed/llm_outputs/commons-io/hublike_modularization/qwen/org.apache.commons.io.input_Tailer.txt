{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, especially considering its interaction with multiple internal and external components like 'IOUtils' which itself has numerous dependencies, indicates hub-like modularization."
