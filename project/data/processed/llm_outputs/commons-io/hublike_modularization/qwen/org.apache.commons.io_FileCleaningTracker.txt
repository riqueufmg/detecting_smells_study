{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaningTracker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FileCleaningTracker.Reaper and FileDeleteStrategy) and 1 incoming dependency (FileCleaner). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
