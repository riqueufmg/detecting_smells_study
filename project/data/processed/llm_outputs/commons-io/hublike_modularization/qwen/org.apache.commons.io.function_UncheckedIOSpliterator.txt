    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to IOSpliterator and no incoming dependencies. The dependency chain shows IOSpliterator depends on 3 other classes (IOConsumer, IOComparator, IOSpliteratorAdapter) but these are not direct dependencies of UncheckedIOSpliterator. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior with numerous direct dependencies."
