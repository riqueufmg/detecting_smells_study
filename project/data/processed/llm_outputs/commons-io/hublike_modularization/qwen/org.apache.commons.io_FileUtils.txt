    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (16) and incoming dependencies (11), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of usage and being used, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
