    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.ScratchBytes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from IOUtils class. The incoming dependencies list shows IOUtils depends on multiple classes including ScratchBytes, but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship from one class, not multiple incoming dependencies from different classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous bidirectional dependencies."
