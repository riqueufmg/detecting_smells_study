    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (IOBiFunction) and 1 incoming dependency (PathVisitorFileFilter). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
