    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies from other classes. The dependencies form a closed ecosystem within the same package where ValidatingObjectInputStream depends on ClassNameMatcher, Builder, and ObjectStreamClassPredicate, but this does not constitute a large number of dependencies indicative of hub-like modularization."
