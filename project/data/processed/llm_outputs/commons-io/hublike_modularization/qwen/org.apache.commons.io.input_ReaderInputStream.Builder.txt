    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ReaderInputStream. The incoming dependency shows ReaderInputStream depends on this Builder class along with other utilities (IOUtils, CharsetEncoders, Charsets), but this represents normal usage patterns where a builder is used by its associated main class. The dependency count is not excessive given the isolated analysis context."
