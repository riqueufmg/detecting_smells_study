{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (IOUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. While IOUtils itself has many dependencies (16), the ProxyWriter class in isolation only maintains a single dependency relationship, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
