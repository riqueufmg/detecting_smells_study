    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader.FilePart",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ReversedLinesFileReader class. The incoming dependency shows ReversedLinesFileReader uses FilePart along with 4 other classes/dependencies, but FilePart itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class appears to be a contained helper class with limited coupling."
