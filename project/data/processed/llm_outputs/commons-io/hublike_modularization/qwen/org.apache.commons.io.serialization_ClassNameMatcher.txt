    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ClassNameMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from ValidatingObjectInputStream and ObjectStreamClassPredicate, and no outgoing dependencies. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
