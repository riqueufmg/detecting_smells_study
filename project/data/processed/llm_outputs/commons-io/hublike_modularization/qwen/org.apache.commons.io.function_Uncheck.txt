    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Uncheck' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes within the same package and incoming dependencies from 18 other classes including multiple classes from the same package and other packages like 'org.apache.commons.io'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Uncheck' acts as a central hub connecting many abstractions, which is the characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
