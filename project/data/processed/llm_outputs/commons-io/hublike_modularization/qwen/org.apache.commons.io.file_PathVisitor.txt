```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.file.PathVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from PathVisitorFileFilter. The incoming dependency references 3 classes including PathVisitor itself, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
}
