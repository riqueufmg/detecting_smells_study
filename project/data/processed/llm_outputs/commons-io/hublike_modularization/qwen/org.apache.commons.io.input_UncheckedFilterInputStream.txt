    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to UncheckedFilterInputStream.Builder and org.apache.commons.io.function.Uncheck. While Uncheck has many dependencies, the UncheckedFilterInputStream itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies."
