    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ReversedLinesFileReader class. The incoming dependencies list shows only one source class with 5 dependencies, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
