    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Input",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only incoming dependencies from 4 other classes and no outgoing dependencies. While it is referenced by multiple classes, the number of dependencies is not excessive for typical software systems, and there is no evidence of it depending on a large number of other abstractions or being a central hub with numerous bidirectional dependencies."
