    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedBufferedReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to IOUtils and no incoming dependencies. While IOUtils itself has many dependencies, the analyzed class UnsynchronizedBufferedReader does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
