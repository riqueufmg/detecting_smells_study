    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.DemuxInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (IOUtils) and 0 incoming dependencies. While IOUtils itself has many dependencies (16 outgoing dependencies), the DemuxInputStream class in isolation only connects to one other abstraction, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
