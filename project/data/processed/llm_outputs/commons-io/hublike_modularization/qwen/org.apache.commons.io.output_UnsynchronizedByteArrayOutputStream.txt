{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.UnsynchronizedByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (IOUtils). The dependent class IOUtils itself has a high number of outgoing dependencies (17), indicating it is a hub. The analyzed class is directly involved in a dense dependency network through IOUtils, which acts as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions. This creates a hub-like modularization pattern where the analyzed class is part of a highly interconnected module structure."
