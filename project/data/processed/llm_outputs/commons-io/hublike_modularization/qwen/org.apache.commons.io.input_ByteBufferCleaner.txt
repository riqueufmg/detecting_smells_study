```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ByteBufferCleaner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to its inner class Cleaner) and 2 incoming dependencies (from MemoryMappedFileInputStream and BufferedFileChannelInputStream). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
