    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.OrFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class OrFileFilter has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IOFileFilter and AbstractFileFilter) and no incoming dependencies. The dependency graph shows a limited number of connections rather than a large number of dependencies with many other abstractions, which would be characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
