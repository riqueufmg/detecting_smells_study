{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.MemoryMappedFileInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from MemoryMappedFileInputStream. The incoming dependency shows that MemoryMappedFileInputStream depends on this Builder class along with two other classes (ByteBufferCleaner and IOUtils), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has limited dependencies."
