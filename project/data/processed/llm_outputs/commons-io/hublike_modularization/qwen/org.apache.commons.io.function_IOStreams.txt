    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOStreams",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class IOStreams has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (2). It does not exhibit a high number of dependencies relative to the context size of 882, nor does it act as a central hub connecting a large number of abstractions. Therefore, it does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
