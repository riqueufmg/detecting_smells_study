{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (QueueOutputStream, IOUtils, QueueInputStream.Builder) and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes (IOUtils, QueueOutputStream). The class IOUtils in particular shows a high number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing with other abstractions, indicating hub-like behavior. Additionally, the bidirectional dependency between QueueInputStream and QueueOutputStream increases coupling, contributing to the hub-like modularization smell."
