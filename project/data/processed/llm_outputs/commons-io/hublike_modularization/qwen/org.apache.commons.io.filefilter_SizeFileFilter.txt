    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from FileFilterUtils which depends on 8 classes including SizeFileFilter. While FileFilterUtils shows hub-like characteristics by depending on multiple classes, SizeFileFilter itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has no dependencies and is only depended upon by one class."
