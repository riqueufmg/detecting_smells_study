    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.BrokenOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase and no incoming dependencies. The dependency to Erase class does not indicate hub-like modularization as it's a single connection, not multiple dependencies to numerous abstractions."
