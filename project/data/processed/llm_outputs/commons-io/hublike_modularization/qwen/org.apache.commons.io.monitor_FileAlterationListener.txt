    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to FileAlterationObserver and one incoming dependency from FileAlterationObserver. The dependencies listed in the observer's dependencies do not represent direct dependencies of FileAlterationListener itself, but rather the observer's own dependencies. Based on the provided data, this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal direct dependencies."
