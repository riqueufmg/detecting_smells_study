{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BrokenReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase and no incoming dependencies. The dependency to Erase class does not indicate hub-like modularization for BrokenReader itself, as BrokenReader is not the central hub connecting to multiple abstractions."
