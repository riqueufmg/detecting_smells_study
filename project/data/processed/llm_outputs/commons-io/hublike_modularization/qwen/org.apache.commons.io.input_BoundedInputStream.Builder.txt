{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BoundedInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from BoundedInputStream. The incoming dependency shows BoundedInputStream depends on this Builder class along with ProxyInputStream and IOBiConsumer, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization where the class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
