    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ProxyOutputStream.Builder and IOUtils. While IOUtils has many dependencies, the ProxyOutputStream itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies."
