    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DeferredFileOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (AbstractByteArrayOutputStream) and 1 incoming dependency (DeferredFileOutputStream). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
