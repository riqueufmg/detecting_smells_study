{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.NullInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IOUtils and UnsupportedOperationExceptions) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency to IOUtils shows it depends on a utility class with many outgoing dependencies itself, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for NullInputStream. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
