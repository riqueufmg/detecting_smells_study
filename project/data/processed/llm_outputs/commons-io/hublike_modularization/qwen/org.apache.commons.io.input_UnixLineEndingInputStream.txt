    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnixLineEndingInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsupportedOperationExceptions' and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
