    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ClosedWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from CloseShieldWriter. This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
