    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.channels.ByteArraySeekableByteChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to IOUtils and no incoming dependencies. While IOUtils itself has many dependencies (16 outgoing), the ByteArraySeekableByteChannel class in isolation only connects to one other abstraction, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
