    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.TailerListenerAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to Tailer class and no incoming dependencies. The Tailer class itself has multiple dependencies, but the TailerListenerAdapter does not directly depend on those classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has minimal dependencies rather than dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
