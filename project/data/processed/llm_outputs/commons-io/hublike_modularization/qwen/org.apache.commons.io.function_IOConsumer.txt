{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.function.IOConsumer' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes ('IOStreams', 'IOExceptionList', 'Uncheck') and incoming dependencies from 13 other classes across multiple packages. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central point connecting many other abstractions."
