    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.build.AbstractStreamBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AbstractStreamBuilder' has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'PathUtils', 'Charsets', and 'IOUtils'. While 'PathUtils' and 'IOUtils' themselves have multiple dependencies, the 'AbstractStreamBuilder' class does not directly depend on those transitive dependencies. The number of direct dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
