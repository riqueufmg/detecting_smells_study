    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from RandomAccessFileInputStream. The incoming dependency shows RandomAccessFileInputStream depends on this Builder class, which is a normal pattern for builder classes. There are no dependencies with a large number of other abstractions - only 1 incoming dependency and 0 outgoing dependencies."
