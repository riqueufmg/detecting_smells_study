    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.Tailer.RandomAccessResourceBridge",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Tailer class. The incoming dependency shows that Tailer depends on this class along with 6 other classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for this specific class since it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
