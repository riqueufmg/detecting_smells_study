```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.FileDeleteStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (FileUtils) and 3 incoming dependencies (FileCleaningTracker, FileCleaningTracker.Tracker, FileCleaner). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
