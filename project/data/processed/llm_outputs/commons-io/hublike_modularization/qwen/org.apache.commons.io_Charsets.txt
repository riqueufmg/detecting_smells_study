    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.Charsets",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.Charsets' has incoming dependencies from 12 different classes across multiple packages, indicating it is widely used. Although it has no outgoing dependencies, the high number of incoming dependencies (12) exceeds typical thresholds for hub-like modularization, suggesting it acts as a central point of dependency in the system."
