    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BrokenInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.io.function.Erase and no incoming dependencies. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
