{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIterable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class IOIterable has only 3 outgoing dependencies (IOConsumer, IOIterator, IOSpliterator) and 1 incoming dependency (UncheckedIOIterable). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
