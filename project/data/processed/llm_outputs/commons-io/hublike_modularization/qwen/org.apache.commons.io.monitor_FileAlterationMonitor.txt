```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileAlterationMonitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FileAlterationObserver and ThreadUtils) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency FileAlterationObserver has multiple dependencies itself, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for FileAlterationMonitor since it only directly depends on 2 classes. A hub-like modularization smell would require the class to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
