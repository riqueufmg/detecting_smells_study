{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReversedLinesFileReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The dependencies are limited to closely related classes (Builder, FilePart) and standard utility classes (Charsets, StandardLineSeparator) plus one functional interface (IOIterator). This does not indicate hub-like modularization as the dependency count is low and the relationships are cohesive to the class's functionality."
