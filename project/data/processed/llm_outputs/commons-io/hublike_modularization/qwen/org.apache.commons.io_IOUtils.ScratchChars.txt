{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.ScratchChars",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from IOUtils class. The incoming dependency shows IOUtils uses ScratchChars along with many other classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for ScratchChars itself since it doesn't have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
