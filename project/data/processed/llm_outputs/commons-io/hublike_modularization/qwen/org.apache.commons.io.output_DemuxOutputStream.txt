    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.DemuxOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils and no incoming dependencies. While IOUtils itself has many dependencies, the DemuxOutputStream class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other classes."
