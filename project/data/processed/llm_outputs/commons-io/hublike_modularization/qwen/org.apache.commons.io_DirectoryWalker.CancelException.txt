{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.DirectoryWalker.CancelException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from DirectoryWalker class. The incoming dependency shows DirectoryWalker depends on CancelException along with other file filter classes, but CancelException itself does not create dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class appears to be a simple exception class with minimal dependencies."
