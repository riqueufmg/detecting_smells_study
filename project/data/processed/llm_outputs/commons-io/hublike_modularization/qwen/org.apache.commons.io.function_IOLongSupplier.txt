    "justification": "The class IOLongSupplier has only one outgoing dependency to Uncheck and appears in the incoming and outgoing dependencies of Uncheck, but there is no evidence that IOLongSupplier itself has direct dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The metrics provided do not indicate hub-like behavior for this class."
