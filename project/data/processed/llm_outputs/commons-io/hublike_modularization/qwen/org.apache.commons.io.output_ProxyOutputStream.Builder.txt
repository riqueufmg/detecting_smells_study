{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ProxyOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ProxyOutputStream class. The incoming dependency includes references to this Builder class and IOUtils, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
