    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.monitor.FileEntry' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (2). It does not exhibit a high number of dependencies with other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are focused and do not indicate a central hub connecting to many other components."
