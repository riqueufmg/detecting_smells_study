    "justification": "The class FileFilterUtils has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (DirectoryWalker), making it a central hub connecting multiple abstractions within the system. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates Hub-like Modularization."
