```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.AndFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IOFileFilter and AbstractFileFilter) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small, indicating focused coupling rather than hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
