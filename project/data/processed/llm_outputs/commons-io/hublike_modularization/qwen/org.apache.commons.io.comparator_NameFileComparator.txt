    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (IOCase) and 1 incoming dependency (FileAlterationObserver). This is not a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. A hub-like structure would require dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not present here."
