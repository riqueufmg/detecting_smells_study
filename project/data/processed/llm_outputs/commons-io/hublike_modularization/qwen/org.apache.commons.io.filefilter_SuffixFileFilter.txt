    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter.SuffixFileFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SuffixFileFilter has only 2 outgoing dependencies (PathUtils and IOCase) and 1 incoming dependency (FileUtils). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
