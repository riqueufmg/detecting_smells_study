{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.BufferedFileChannelInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from BufferedFileChannelInputStream. The incoming dependency shows that BufferedFileChannelInputStream depends on this Builder class along with three other classes (ByteBufferCleaner, Input, IOUtils), but this represents a normal builder pattern relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
