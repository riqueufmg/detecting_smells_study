    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to IOUtils, ReaderInputStream.Builder, CharsetEncoders, and Charsets. The incoming dependency is from CharSequenceInputStream. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization as it does not show excessive or numerous connections to other abstractions."
