{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from XmlStreamReader class. The incoming dependencies show that XmlStreamReader depends on this Builder class along with other classes (BOMInputStream, XmlStreamReaderException, IOUtils, ByteOrderMark), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the Builder class itself. The Builder class appears to be a focused utility class with limited dependencies."
