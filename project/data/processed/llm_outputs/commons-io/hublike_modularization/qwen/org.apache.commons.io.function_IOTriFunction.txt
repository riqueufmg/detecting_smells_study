    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOTriFunction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'IOTriFunction' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'IOUtils' and 'Uncheck', which depend on a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'IOFunction', which itself depends on multiple other abstractions such as 'IOConsumer', 'Uncheck', 'Constants', and 'IOSupplier'. This pattern of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
