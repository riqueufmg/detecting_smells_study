    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.QueueInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from QueueInputStream class. The incoming dependencies list shows QueueInputStream depends on this Builder class along with two other classes, but this does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization. The class appears to be a simple builder pattern implementation with limited coupling."
