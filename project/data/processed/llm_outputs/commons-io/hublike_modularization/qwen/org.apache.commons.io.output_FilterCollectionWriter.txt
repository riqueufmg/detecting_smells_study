{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.FilterCollectionWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IOConsumer and IOExceptionList) and no incoming dependencies. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
