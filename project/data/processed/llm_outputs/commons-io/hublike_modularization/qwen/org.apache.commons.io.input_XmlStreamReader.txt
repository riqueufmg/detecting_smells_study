```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class XmlStreamReader has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (BOMInputStream, XmlStreamReader.Builder, XmlStreamReaderException, IOUtils, ByteOrderMark) and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class (XmlStreamWriter). The dependency on IOUtils is particularly significant as IOUtils itself has 16 outgoing dependencies, indicating it is a highly connected class. XmlStreamReader acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
