    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.TaggedIOException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies (none) and 4 incoming dependencies from closely related classes (TaggedInputStream, TaggedReader, TaggedOutputStream, TaggedWriter) within the same package hierarchy. This represents a focused, localized dependency pattern rather than hub-like modularization, as the dependencies are limited to a small number of related abstractions within the same domain (IO tagging functionality)."
