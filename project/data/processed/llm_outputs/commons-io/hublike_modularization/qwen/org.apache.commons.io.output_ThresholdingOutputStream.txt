{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ThresholdingOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to IOConsumer, IOUtils, NullOutputStream, and IOFunction, which are all directly related to its functionality as an output stream with thresholding behavior. The dependencies are not excessive in number or scope, and the class does not act as a central hub connecting many unrelated abstractions."
