    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NullWriter has only one outgoing dependency (to IOUtils) and appears in the incoming dependencies of only one other class (IOUtils). This does not indicate a hub-like modularization pattern, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
