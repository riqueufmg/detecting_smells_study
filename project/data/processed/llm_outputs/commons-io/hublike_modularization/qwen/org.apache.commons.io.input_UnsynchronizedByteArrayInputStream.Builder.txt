    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.UnsynchronizedByteArrayInputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class UnsynchronizedByteArrayInputStream. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions."
