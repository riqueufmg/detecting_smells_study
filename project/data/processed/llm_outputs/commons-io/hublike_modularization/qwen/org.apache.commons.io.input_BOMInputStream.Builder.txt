    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (ByteOrderMark) and 1 incoming dependency (BOMInputStream). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
