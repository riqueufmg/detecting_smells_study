```json
{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.ByteArrayOutputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 class (IOUtils) which itself has dependencies to 17 other abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 classes (IOUtils and DeferredFileOutputStream), one of which (IOUtils) has dependencies to 17 other abstractions. This creates a hub-like dependency pattern where ByteArrayOutputStream is centrally connected through IOUtils to a large number of other abstractions."
