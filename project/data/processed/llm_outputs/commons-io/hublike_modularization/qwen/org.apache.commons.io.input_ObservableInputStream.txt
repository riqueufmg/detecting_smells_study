    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes, and some of these dependencies themselves have further outgoing dependencies, indicating it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. Specifically, IOUtils has 16 outgoing dependencies and ProxyInputStream has 4 outgoing dependencies, suggesting this class is highly connected in the dependency graph."
