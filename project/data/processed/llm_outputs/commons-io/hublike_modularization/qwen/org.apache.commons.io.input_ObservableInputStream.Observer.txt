{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.input.ObservableInputStream.Observer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ObservableInputStream. The incoming dependency shows ObservableInputStream depends on this class along with 4 other classes, but this class itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class appears to be a simple observer interface with limited coupling."
