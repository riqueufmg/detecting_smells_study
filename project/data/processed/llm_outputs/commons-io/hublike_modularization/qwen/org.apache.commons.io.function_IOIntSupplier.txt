    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOIntSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class IOIntSupplier has only one outgoing dependency to Uncheck and is involved in only one incoming dependency from Uncheck. The high number of dependencies in the Uncheck class does not directly involve IOIntSupplier itself having many dependencies, thus not meeting the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
