{
    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.output.WriterOutputStream.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from WriterOutputStream. The incoming dependency shows WriterOutputStream depends on this Builder class, but this represents a typical builder pattern relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
