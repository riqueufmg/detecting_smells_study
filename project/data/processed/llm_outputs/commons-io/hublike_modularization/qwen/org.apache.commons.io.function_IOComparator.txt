    "class": "org.apache.commons.io.function.IOComparator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class IOComparator has outgoing dependencies to Uncheck, which in turn depends on 15 other classes. Additionally, IOComparator has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including IOSpliterator, Uncheck, IOStream, IOBinaryOperator, and Erase. This creates a hub-like dependency pattern where IOComparator is central to many dependencies both incoming and outgoing."
