    "justification": "The class 'org.apache.commons.io.file.Counters' has incoming dependencies from 6 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes. The number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions within the system."
