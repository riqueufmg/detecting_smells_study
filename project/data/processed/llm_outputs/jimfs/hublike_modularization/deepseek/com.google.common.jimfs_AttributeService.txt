    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeService",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (FileLookup, StandardAttributeProviders, AttributeProvider, Configuration, File, AttributeCopyOption) and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileStore). This high number of distinct dependencies (8 total) indicates it acts as a central hub interacting with many other abstractions."
