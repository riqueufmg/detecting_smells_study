    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 other abstractions (Configuration.WindowsHolder, SystemFileTimeSource, WatchServiceConfiguration, Configuration.OsxHolder, Configuration.Builder, PathType, Configuration.UnixHolder, FileTimeSource) and incoming dependencies from 7 other abstractions (JimfsFileSystems, PathService, Jimfs, HeapDisk, AttributeService, Configuration.UnixHolder, Configuration.OsxHolder, Configuration.WindowsHolder). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
