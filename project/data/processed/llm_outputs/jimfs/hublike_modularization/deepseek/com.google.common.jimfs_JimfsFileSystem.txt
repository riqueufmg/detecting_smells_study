    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystem",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (PathService, JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, JimfsFileSystemProvider, WatchServiceConfiguration, JimfsPath) and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsPath, Jimfs, JimfsFileSystemProvider). This constitutes a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, indicating it acts as a central hub."
