    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (PathType, Configuration, PathNormalization, JimfsPath, PathMatchers, Name) and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes (JimfsFileSystems, FileSystemView, JimfsFileSystem, PollingWatchService, WatchServiceConfiguration, JimfsPath). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
