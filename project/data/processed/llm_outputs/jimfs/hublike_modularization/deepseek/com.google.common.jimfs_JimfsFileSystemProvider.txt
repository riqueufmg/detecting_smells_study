    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystemProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions (FileSystemView, JimfsFileSystem, JimfsFileChannel, RegularFile, JimfsPath, Options) and incoming dependencies from 3 other abstractions (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileSystem, Jimfs). This constitutes a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, indicating it acts as a central hub."
