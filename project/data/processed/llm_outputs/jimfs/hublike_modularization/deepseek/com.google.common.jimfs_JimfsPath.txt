    "justification": "JimfsPath has 5 outgoing dependencies (PathService, JimfsFileSystem, AbstractWatchService, Name, Options) and is referenced by 11 incoming dependencies (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileStore, FileSystemView, JimfsFileSystem, PollingWatchService, PathService, SymbolicLink, JimfsFileSystemProvider, FileFactory, FileFactory.SymbolicLinkSupplier, FileTree, JimfsSecureDirectoryStream). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
