    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JimfsFileStore has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes (FileSystemState, File, HeapDisk, JimfsPath, FileTree, FileLookup, Directory, DirectoryEntry, Feature, AttributeService, Name, AttributeCopyOption, FileFactory) and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (JimfsFileSystems, FileSystemView, JimfsFileSystem). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that JimfsFileStore acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions within the system."
