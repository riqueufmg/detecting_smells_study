{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.OwnerAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (File, FileLookup, UserLookupService) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
