    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to WatchServiceConfiguration, PathType, SystemFileTimeSource, and FileTimeSource. The incoming dependency is from Configuration. None of these dependencies indicate a large number of interactions that would classify this as hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit a high degree of connectivity to many other abstractions."
