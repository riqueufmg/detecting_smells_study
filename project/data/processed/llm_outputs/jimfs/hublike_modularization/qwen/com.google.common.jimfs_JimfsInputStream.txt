{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsInputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FileSystemState and RegularFile) and no incoming dependencies. While it depends on RegularFile which has 4 dependencies itself, the JimfsInputStream class only directly interacts with 2 other classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
