    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to Configuration) and one incoming dependency (from Configuration). While Configuration itself has multiple dependencies, the WindowsHolder class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not directly depend on or interact with a large number of other abstractions."
