    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsAsynchronousFileChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (JimfsFileChannel and Util) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are minimal and focused, not indicating a large number of dependencies with other abstractions that would characterize hub-like modularization."
