{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemState",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemState' has incoming dependencies from 8 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class. The high number of incoming dependencies (>= 5) indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, which is a strong indicator of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it depends on 'FileTimeSource', showing outgoing dependency. This central role with both high incoming and outgoing connections confirms the presence of the smell."
