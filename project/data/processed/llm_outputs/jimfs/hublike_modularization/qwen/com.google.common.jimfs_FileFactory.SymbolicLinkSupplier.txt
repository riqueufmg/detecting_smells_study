    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory.SymbolicLinkSupplier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to JimfsPath and no incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling with only one direct dependency, which does not constitute a hub-like pattern where there would be dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
