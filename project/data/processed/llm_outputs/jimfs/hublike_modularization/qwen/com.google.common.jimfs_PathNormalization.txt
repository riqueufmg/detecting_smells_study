    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathNormalization",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from PathService and PathMatchers, and no outgoing dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
