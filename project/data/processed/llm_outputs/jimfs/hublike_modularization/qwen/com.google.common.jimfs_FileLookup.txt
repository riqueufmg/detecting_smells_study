    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.common.jimfs.FileLookup' has incoming dependencies from 12 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class. The high number of incoming dependencies (12) indicates that many other abstractions depend on this class, which is a strong indicator of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, while its outgoing dependencies are minimal, the central role it plays in the dependency structure, as evidenced by the incoming dependencies, confirms the presence of the smell."
