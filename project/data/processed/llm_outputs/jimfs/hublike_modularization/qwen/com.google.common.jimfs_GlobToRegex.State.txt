    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex.State",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from GlobToRegex class. The low number of dependencies (only 1 incoming and 0 outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
