    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UnixAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (UnixFileAttributeView, File, FileLookup) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
