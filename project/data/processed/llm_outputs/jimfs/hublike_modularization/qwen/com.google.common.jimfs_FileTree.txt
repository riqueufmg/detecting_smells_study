    "justification": "FileTree has outgoing dependencies to 7 classes (JimfsPath, File, SymbolicLink, Directory, DirectoryEntry, Name, Options) and incoming dependencies from JimfsFileStore which itself depends on 12 classes including FileTree. This creates a hub-like dependency structure where FileTree is central to many dependencies both incoming and outgoing."
