    "justification": "The class 'com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystems' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
