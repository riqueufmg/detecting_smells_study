    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "JimfsPath has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 12 other classes. The high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that JimfsPath is a central abstraction that interacts with many other parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
