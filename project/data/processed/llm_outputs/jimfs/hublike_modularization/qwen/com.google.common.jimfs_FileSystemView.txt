    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView' has outgoing dependencies to 16 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions between many other components in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
