    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.RegularFile",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.common.jimfs.RegularFile' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (Java8Compatibility, File, Util, HeapDisk) and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes (FileSystemView, HeapDisk, JimfsFileChannel, JimfsInputStream, JimfsFileSystemProvider, FileFactory, JimfsOutputStream). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that RegularFile acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
