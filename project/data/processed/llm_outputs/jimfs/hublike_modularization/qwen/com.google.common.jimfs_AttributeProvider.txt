{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (File and FileLookup) and 2 incoming dependencies (StandardAttributeProviders and AttributeService). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
