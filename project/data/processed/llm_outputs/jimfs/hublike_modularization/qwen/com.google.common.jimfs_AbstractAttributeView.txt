    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AbstractAttributeView",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (File and FileLookup) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
