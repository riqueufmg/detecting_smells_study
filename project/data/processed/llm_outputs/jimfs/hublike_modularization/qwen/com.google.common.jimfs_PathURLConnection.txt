    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathURLConnection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies, indicating it does not interact with any other abstractions in the system. Since there are zero dependencies in both directions, it cannot exhibit hub-like modularization which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
