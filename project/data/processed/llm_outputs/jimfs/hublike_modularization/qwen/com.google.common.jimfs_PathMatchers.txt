    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathMatchers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (PathNormalization and GlobToRegex) and 1 incoming dependency (PathService). This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
