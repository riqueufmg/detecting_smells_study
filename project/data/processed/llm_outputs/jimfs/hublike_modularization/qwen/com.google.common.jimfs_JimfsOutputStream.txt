{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsOutputStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FileSystemState and RegularFile) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies show a limited scope of interaction with closely related classes within the same package, which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
