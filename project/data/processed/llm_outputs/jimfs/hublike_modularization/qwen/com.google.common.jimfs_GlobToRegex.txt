{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (InternalCharMatcher and GlobToRegex.State) and 1 incoming dependency (PathMatchers). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization smell, as it does not show dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
