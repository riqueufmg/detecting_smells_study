{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.WindowsPathType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from PathType which references it along with two other classes. The dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
