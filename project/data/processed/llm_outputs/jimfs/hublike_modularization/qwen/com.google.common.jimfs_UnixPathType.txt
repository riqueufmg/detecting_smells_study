{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.UnixPathType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to PathType and one incoming dependency from PathType. The dependency relationships show limited coupling with only 1 unique dependent class, which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
