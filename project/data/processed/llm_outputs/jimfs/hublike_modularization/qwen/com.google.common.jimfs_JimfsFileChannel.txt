    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileChannel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies (FileSystemState, Util, RegularFile) and 2 incoming dependencies (JimfsFileSystemProvider, JimfsAsynchronousFileChannel). The number of dependencies is moderate and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
