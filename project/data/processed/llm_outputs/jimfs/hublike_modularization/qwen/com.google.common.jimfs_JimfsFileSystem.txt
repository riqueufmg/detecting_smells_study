{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystem",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystem' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (FileSystemView, JimfsPath, JimfsFileStore, JimfsFileSystemProvider, WatchServiceConfiguration, PathService) and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsPath, Jimfs, JimfsFileSystemProvider). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub within the module, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
