{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystemProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JimfsFileSystemProvider has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (RegularFile, FileSystemView, JimfsPath, JimfsFileChannel, Options, JimfsFileSystem) and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileSystem, Jimfs). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a central hub connecting multiple parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
