{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.InternalCharMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one incoming dependency from com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex and no outgoing dependencies. The single incoming dependency references two classes including InternalCharMatcher, but this does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
