{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.StandardAttributeProviders",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (AttributeProvider) and 1 incoming dependency (AttributeService). The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
