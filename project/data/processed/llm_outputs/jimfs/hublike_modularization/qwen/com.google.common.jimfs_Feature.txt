    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.Feature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'com.google.common.jimfs.Feature' has no outgoing dependencies and only appears as a dependency in two incoming dependencies from 'JimfsFileStore' and 'FileSystemView'. While it is referenced by multiple classes, it does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions nor does it have a high number of outgoing connections. The incoming dependencies are limited to two classes within the same package."
