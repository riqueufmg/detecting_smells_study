{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeService",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AttributeService' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (Configuration, StandardAttributeProviders, FileLookup, File, AttributeProvider, AttributeCopyOption) and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes (JimfsFileSystems, JimfsFileStore), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of usage and being used, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
