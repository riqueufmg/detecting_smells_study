{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.PathType.ParseResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from PathType class. The incoming dependency shows PathType references ParseResult along with two other classes (UnixPathType and WindowsPathType), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
