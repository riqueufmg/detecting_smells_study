{
    "class": "com.google.common.jimfs.DosAttributeProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (File, FileLookup, BasicAttributeProvider) and no incoming dependencies. The dependency count is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
