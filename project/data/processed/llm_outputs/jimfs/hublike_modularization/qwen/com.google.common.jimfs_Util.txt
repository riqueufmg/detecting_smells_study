    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies but is depended upon by 4 other classes (Name, JimfsFileChannel, RegularFile, JimfsAsynchronousFileChannel), creating a hub-like structure where Util serves as a central dependency point with multiple incoming dependencies but no outgoing ones, indicating hub-like modularization."
