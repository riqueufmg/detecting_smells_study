    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ReturnStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 28 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not indicate a 'large number' of dependencies that would characterize a hub-like modularization smell. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including expected relationships with metamodel, visitor, and utility classes."
