    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleExportsDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 29 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not indicate a hub-like modularization, which typically involves a very large number of dependencies (often dozens or hundreds). The dependencies are primarily to core framework classes (Node, visitors, metamodel) and from visitor implementations, which is expected for an AST node in a parser framework."
