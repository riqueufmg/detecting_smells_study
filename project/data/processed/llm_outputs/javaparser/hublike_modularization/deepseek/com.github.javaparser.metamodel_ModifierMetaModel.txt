    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (Modifier and JavaParserMetaModel). This small number of dependencies (total of 3 distinct abstractions) does not indicate a hub-like structure with a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
