    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SuperExpr has 10 outgoing dependencies (imports) and 16 incoming dependencies (classes that depend on it). While the incoming dependencies are numerous, they are primarily visitor classes and printers that must handle all AST node types. The outgoing dependencies are standard for an AST node (parent classes, utility classes, metamodel). The total number of distinct dependencies is not excessively large for a core AST node in a parser framework."
