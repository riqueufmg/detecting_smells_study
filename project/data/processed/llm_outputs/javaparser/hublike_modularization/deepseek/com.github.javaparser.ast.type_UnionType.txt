    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UnionType has 12 outgoing dependencies and 17 incoming dependencies, totaling 29 dependencies. This is not a large number of dependencies compared to typical hub-like modularization thresholds. The dependencies are primarily to core framework classes (Node, NodeList, visitors, metamodel) and resolution types, which is expected for an AST node in a parser framework."
