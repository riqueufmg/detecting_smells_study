    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It has 112 outgoing dependencies (listed in the 'dependencies' array) and 0 incoming dependencies. The sheer number of distinct classes it depends on qualifies it as a hub-like modularization."
