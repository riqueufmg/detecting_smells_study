    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.EmptyStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 outgoing dependencies (Range, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, EmptyStmtMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel) and 15 incoming dependencies from various visitor and utility classes. While there are multiple incoming dependencies, the total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is not large enough to constitute a hub-like modularization. The class serves as a simple AST node with typical visitor pattern dependencies."
