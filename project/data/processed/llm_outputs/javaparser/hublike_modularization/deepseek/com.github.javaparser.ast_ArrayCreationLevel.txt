    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies (from visitor classes that depend on many AST nodes). While the incoming dependencies are numerous, they come from generic visitor classes that must depend on all AST node types by design. The class itself does not have a large number of unique dependencies in either direction relative to typical hub-like classes."
