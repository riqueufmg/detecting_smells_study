    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 distinct classes (ProblemReporter, Node) and incoming dependencies from 15 distinct classes (TreeVisitorValidator, Validators, Java1_2Validator, Java22Validator, Java17Validator, Java1_0Validator, Java8Validator, Java11Validator, Java10Validator, Java14Validator, Java1_1Validator, Java5Validator, Java9Validator, ParserConfiguration, ParserConfiguration.LanguageLevel). This large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
