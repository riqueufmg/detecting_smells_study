    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and 2 incoming dependencies (CatchClause and JavaParserMetaModel). This small number of dependencies (total 3 distinct abstractions) does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate Hub-like Modularization."
