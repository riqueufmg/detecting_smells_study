    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (ResolvedType, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration) and incoming dependencies from 10 abstractions (Bound, TypeInference, Instantiation, BoundSet, BoundSet.VariableDependency, InferenceVariableSubstitution, ProperLowerBound, ProperUpperBound, ExpressionCompatibleWithType, ThrowsBound). This high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
