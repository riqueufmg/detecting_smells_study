    "justification": "The class has 11 outgoing dependencies and 20 incoming dependencies, totaling 31 dependencies. While this is a moderate number, it does not reach the threshold of being considered a 'large number' of dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including base classes, visitors, and related model classes."
