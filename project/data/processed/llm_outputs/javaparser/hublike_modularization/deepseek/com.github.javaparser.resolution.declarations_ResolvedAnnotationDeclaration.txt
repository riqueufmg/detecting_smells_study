    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedAnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (5 distinct classes: JavaSymbolSolver, JavaParserFacade, AnnotationDeclaration, AnnotationExpr, ResolvedTypeDeclaration). It has no outgoing dependencies. According to the definition, Hub-like Modularization arises when an abstraction has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The high number of incoming dependencies qualifies it as a hub."
