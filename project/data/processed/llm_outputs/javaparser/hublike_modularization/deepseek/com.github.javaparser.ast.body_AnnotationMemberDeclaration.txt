    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 outgoing dependencies (to classes like Expression, Node, Type, SimpleName, etc.) and 19 incoming dependencies (from classes like BodyDeclaration, VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, DefaultVisitorAdapter, etc.), totaling 32 distinct dependencies. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub connecting many other abstractions."
