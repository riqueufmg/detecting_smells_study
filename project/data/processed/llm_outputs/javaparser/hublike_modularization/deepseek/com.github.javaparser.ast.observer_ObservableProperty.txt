    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 4 outgoing dependencies and 84 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 88 dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub in the dependency graph."
