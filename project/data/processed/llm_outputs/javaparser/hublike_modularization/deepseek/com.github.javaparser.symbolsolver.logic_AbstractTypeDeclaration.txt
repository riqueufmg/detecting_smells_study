    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 class (MethodUsage) and incoming dependencies from 6 classes (ReflectionMethodDeclaration, ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionFactory, ReflectionEnumDeclaration, ReflectionRecordDeclaration, ReflectionConstructorDeclaration). The total number of distinct dependency connections (both incoming and outgoing) is 7, which is a large number of other abstractions, indicating a hub-like structure."
