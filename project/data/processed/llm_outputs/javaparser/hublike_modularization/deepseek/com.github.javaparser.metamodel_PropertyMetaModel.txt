    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large number of incoming dependencies (over 100 classes from various metamodel classes, JavaParserMetaModel, JavaParserJsonDeserializer, and several generator classes) and outgoing dependencies to BaseNodeMetaModel, CodeGenerationUtils, and Node. This high coupling with many other abstractions in both directions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
