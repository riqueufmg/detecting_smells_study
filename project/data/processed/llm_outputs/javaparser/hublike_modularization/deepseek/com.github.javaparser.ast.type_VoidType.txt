    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VoidType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 10 outgoing dependencies and 17 incoming dependencies, totaling 27 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not indicate an excessively large number of dependencies that would characterize a hub-like modularization. The dependencies are typical for a node type in an AST framework, connecting to core framework classes (e.g., Range, TokenRange, NodeList, visitors, metamodel) and being referenced by visitors and utility classes."
