    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 outgoing dependencies and 16 incoming dependencies, totaling 24 dependencies. While this is a moderate number, it does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including base classes, visitors, metamodel components, and printer utilities."
