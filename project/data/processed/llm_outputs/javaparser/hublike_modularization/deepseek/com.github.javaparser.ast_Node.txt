    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 outgoing dependencies (dependencies list) and 176 incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies list), totaling 200 dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates a hub-like structure where the class is highly coupled with many other components."
