    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies, which does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies in both directions. The outgoing dependencies are typical utility and framework classes, while incoming dependencies are primarily visitor implementations and printers that naturally depend on all AST node types."
