    "justification": "LazyType has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions: 7 outgoing dependencies (ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedArrayType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedType) and 2 incoming dependencies (TypeExtractor, ResolvedReferenceType). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
