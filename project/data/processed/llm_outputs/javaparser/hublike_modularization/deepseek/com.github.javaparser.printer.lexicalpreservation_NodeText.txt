    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (TextElementMatchers, TextElementMatcher, Node, TextElement) and incoming dependencies from 8 other abstractions (LexicalDifferenceCalculator, DifferenceElementCalculator, LexicalPreservingPrinter, Difference, TextElementIteratorsFactory, ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor, DefaultLexicalPreservingPrinter, ChildTextElement). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
