    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ClassExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassExpr has only 9 outgoing dependencies (Range, Node, Type, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel, ClassExprMetaModel, ObservableProperty) and 16 incoming dependencies from various visitor classes and other components. While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is moderate and does not indicate an excessive coupling that would characterize a hub-like modularization. The class serves as a specific expression node in the AST rather than a central coordination point."
