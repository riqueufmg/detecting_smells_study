    "detection": false,
    "justification": "RecordPatternExpr has only 10 outgoing dependencies (Node, Type, ReferenceType, NodeList, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, ObservableProperty, RecordPatternExprMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel) and 16 incoming dependencies from visitor classes. While the incoming dependencies are numerous, they come from a single category (visitor implementations) and the total number of distinct dependency connections is moderate. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with a large number of diverse incoming and outgoing dependencies."
