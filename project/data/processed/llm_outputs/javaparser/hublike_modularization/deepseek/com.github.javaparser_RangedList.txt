    "class": "com.github.javaparser.RangedList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class RangedList has only 3 outgoing dependencies (JavaToken, TokenRange, NodeList) and 1 incoming dependency (from GeneratedJavaParser). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction, so it does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
