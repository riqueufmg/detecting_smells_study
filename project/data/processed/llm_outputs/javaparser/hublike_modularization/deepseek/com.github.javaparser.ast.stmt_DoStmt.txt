    "detection": false,
    "justification": "DoStmt has only 10 outgoing dependencies (Expression, Range, Node, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel, ObservableProperty, DoStmtMetaModel, Statement) and 16 incoming dependencies from various visitor and context classes. While the incoming dependencies are numerous, they come from a limited set of abstraction types (visitors, printers, parsers) that naturally depend on all statement types. The total number of distinct dependency connections is not excessively large for a core AST node in a parser framework."
