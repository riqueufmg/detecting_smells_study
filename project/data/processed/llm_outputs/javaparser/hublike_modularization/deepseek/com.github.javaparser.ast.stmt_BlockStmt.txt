    "detection": true,
    "justification": "BlockStmt has 9 outgoing dependencies (including Node, NodeList, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, etc.) and 48 incoming dependencies from various classes across multiple packages (including InitializerDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, FieldDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration, various visitors, printers, generators, and symbol solvers). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub connecting many abstractions."
