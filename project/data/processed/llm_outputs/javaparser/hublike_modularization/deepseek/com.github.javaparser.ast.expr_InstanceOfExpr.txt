    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.InstanceOfExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 outgoing dependencies and 17 incoming dependencies, totaling 29 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not indicate an excessively large number of dependencies that would characterize a hub-like modularization smell. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including expected relationships with base classes (Expression, Node), types (Type, ReferenceType), visitors (GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor), and metamodel components."
