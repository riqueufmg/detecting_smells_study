{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.AssertStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency (from Statement class), which is not a large number of dependencies in either direction. The outgoing dependencies are typical for an AST node class (base classes, visitors, metamodel). The incoming dependency is from its parent class Statement, which is expected. This does not meet the threshold for Hub-like Modularization."
