    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 17 outgoing dependencies and 28 incoming dependencies from distinct classes, resulting in a total of 45 distinct dependency relationships. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions."
