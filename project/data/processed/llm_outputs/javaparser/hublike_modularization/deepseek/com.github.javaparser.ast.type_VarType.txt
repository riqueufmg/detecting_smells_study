    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VarType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "VarType has only 12 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies (from incoming_dependencies list). While it participates in the type hierarchy and visitor patterns, the total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is not excessively large compared to typical hub-like classes. The dependencies are primarily to core AST classes (Node, Type, Expression), visitors, and metamodel classes, which is expected for an AST node type in a parser framework."
