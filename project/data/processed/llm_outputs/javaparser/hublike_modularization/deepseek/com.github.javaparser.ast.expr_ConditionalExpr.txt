    "justification": "The class has only 9 outgoing dependencies (direct dependencies) and 19 incoming dependencies (classes that depend on it). While the incoming dependencies include many visitor classes, the total number of dependencies (28) is not exceptionally large for a core AST node class in a parser framework. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with an excessive number of both incoming and outgoing connections."
