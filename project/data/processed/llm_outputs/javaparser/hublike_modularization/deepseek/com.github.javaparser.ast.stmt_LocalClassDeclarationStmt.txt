    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.LocalClassDeclarationStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 outgoing dependencies (direct dependencies) and 16 incoming dependencies (classes that depend on it). While some of its dependencies (like GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel) have many dependencies themselves, the analyzed class itself does not have a large number of direct dependencies in either direction. The total number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies is not large enough to indicate hub-like modularization."
