    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.YieldStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 8 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies in either direction. The outgoing dependencies are typical for an AST node (base classes, visitors, metamodel). The incoming dependencies are primarily from visitor classes that need to handle all statement types, which is expected for a statement node in a parser framework."
