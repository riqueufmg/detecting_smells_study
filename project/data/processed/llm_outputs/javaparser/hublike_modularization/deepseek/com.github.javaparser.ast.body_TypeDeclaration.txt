    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 13 outgoing dependencies and 12 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 25 distinct dependency relationships with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub in the dependency graph."
