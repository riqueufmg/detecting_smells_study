    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NullLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 outgoing dependencies (Range, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, NullLiteralExprMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel) and 14 incoming dependencies from various visitor classes and utilities. While the incoming dependencies are numerous, they are all from visitor interfaces and printer classes that naturally depend on all expression types in the AST. The outgoing dependencies are minimal and typical for an AST node class. The total number of distinct dependencies is not excessively large for an AST node in a parser framework."
