    "justification": "EnclosedExpr has only 9 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies (from 19 different classes). The total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is relatively small and does not indicate a hub-like structure with a large number of connections to many other abstractions."
