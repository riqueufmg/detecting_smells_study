    "justification": "The class has only 9 outgoing dependencies (direct dependencies) and 19 incoming dependencies (classes that depend on it). While the incoming dependencies include many visitor classes, the total number of distinct dependencies is not excessively large. The class does not act as a central hub with a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
