    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ForStmt has 11 outgoing dependencies (direct dependencies) and 19 incoming dependencies (classes that depend on it). While the number of incoming dependencies is moderately high, the outgoing dependencies are relatively low. The class does not exhibit an extremely large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies that would characterize a hub-like modularization smell."
