    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NoCommentEqualsVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. It depends on 108 different classes (outgoing dependencies), which is an extremely high number. This makes it act as a hub that connects to many different parts of the system, violating the principle of modularization where abstractions should have limited, focused dependencies."
