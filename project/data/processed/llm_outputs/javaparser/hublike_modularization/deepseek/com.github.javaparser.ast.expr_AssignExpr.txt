    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.AssignExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 30 dependencies. While this is a moderate number, it does not reach the threshold of being 'large' relative to typical hub-like modularization cases where abstractions have dependencies numbering in the hundreds. The dependencies are primarily to core AST classes (Expression, Node, Range, TokenRange), visitor interfaces, and metamodel classes, which is expected for a node in an AST hierarchy."
