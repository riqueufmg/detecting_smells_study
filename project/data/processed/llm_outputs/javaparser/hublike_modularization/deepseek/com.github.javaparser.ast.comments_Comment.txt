    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 outgoing dependencies and 14 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 25 distinct dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates the class acts as a central hub in the dependency graph."
