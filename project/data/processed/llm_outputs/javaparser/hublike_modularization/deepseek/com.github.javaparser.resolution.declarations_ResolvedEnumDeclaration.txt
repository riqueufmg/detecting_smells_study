    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration) and four incoming dependencies (JavaSymbolSolver, FieldAccessContext, EnumDeclaration, ResolvedTypeDeclaration). This total of five distinct dependency connections does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies relative to typical hub-like modularization thresholds."
