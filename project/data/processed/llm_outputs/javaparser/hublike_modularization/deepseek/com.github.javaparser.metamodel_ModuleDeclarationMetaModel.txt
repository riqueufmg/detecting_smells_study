    "justification": "The analyzed class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (ModuleDeclaration and JavaParserMetaModel). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction, so it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
