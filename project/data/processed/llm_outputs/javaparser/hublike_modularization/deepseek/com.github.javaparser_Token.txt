    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Token",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (6 classes: JavaToken, GeneratedJavaParserBase, GeneratedJavaParserTokenManagerBase, GeneratedJavaParser, GeneratedJavaParser.JJCalls, ParseException). It has no outgoing dependencies, but the definition focuses on dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The significant number of distinct incoming dependent classes indicates hub-like coupling."
