    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies (from 15 distinct classes). While it has dependencies in both directions, the total number of distinct dependencies (28) is not considered 'large' enough to qualify as a hub-like modularization. The class serves as a specific AST node type with typical dependencies for its role in the parser framework."
