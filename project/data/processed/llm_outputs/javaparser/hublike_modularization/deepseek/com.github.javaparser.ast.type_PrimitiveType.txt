    "justification": "PrimitiveType has 13 outgoing dependencies (including GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel, etc.) and 19 incoming dependencies from various visitors, printers, and other classes (including DefaultVisitorAdapter, JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor, ClassOrInterfaceType, Type, and multiple visitor implementations). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
