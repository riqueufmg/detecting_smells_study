    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 11 outgoing dependencies and 21 incoming dependencies, totaling 32 dependencies. While this is a moderate number, it does not reach the threshold of being 'large' enough to indicate Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including visitor interfaces, base classes, and metamodel components."
