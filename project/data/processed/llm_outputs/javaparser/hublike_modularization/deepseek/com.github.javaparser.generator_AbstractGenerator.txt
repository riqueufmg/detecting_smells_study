    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 13 other abstractions (StaticJavaParser, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, CallableDeclaration, Statement, SwitchStmt, TypeDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, NodeList, ParseResult, EnumDeclaration, Expression, SourceRoot, CompilationUnit). This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, coupling with many other abstractions."
