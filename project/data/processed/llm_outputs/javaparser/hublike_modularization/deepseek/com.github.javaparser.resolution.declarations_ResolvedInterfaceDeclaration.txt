    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies (5 classes depend on it: ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, JavaParserInterfaceDeclaration, TypeInference, JavassistInterfaceDeclaration, ResolvedTypeDeclaration). It also has outgoing dependencies (0). The large number of incoming dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub used by many other abstractions."
