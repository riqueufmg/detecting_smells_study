    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BooleanLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies in either direction. The outgoing dependencies are typical for an AST node class (Range, TokenRange, visitor interfaces, metamodel classes). The incoming dependencies are primarily from visitor classes that visit all AST node types, which is expected for a leaf node in a visitor pattern implementation."
