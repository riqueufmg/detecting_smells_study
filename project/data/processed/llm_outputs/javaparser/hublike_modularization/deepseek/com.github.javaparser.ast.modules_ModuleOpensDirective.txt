    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies (from 15 distinct classes). The total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is relatively small and does not indicate a hub-like structure with a large number of connections to many other abstractions."
