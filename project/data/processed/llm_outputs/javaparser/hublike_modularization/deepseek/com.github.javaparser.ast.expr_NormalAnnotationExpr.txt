    "justification": "The class has 13 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 32 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not indicate a hub-like modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a 'large number' of other abstractions. The dependencies are typical for a node in an AST hierarchy (e.g., base classes, visitors, metamodel)."
