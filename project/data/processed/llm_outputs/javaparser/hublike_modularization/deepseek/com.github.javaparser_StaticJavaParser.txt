    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 27 outgoing dependencies and 33 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 60 distinct dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates the class acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions across many different parts of the system."
