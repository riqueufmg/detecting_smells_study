    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 100 different classes, which is an extremely large number of dependencies. This indicates the class acts as a central hub that interacts with a vast portion of the system's abstractions, fitting the definition of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
