    "justification": "CastExpr has only 10 direct dependencies (outgoing) and is directly used by 19 incoming classes. While some of its dependencies (like Expression, Node, Type) are themselves hubs, CastExpr itself does not have a large number of direct dependencies or dependents that would qualify it as a hub-like modularization."
