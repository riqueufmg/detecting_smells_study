    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SwitchExpr has only 10 outgoing dependencies (Expression, Node, SwitchEntry, SwitchExprMetaModel, NodeList, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, ObservableProperty, JavaParserMetaModel) and 17 incoming dependencies from visitor classes and other components. While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the total number of distinct dependencies is moderate (27 total distinct classes). The outgoing dependencies are limited to core AST classes and visitors, not indicating hub-like coupling with a large number of diverse abstractions."
