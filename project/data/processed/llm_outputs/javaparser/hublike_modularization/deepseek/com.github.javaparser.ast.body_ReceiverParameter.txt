    "justification": "The class has 10 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 29 dependencies. While this is a moderate number, it does not reach the threshold of being 'large' enough to indicate Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for a node in an AST hierarchy, including base classes (Node), related types (Type, Name), visitors, and metamodel components."
