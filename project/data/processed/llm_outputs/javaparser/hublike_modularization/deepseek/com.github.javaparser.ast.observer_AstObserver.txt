    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct classes (AstObserver.ListChangeType, Node, ObservableProperty, NodeList) and incoming dependencies from 7 distinct classes (NodeList, Node, PropagatingAstObserver, Observable, LexicalPreservingPrinter, LexicalPreservingPrinter.Observer, PhantomNodeLogic), resulting in a total of 11 distinct dependency connections, which indicates a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing."
