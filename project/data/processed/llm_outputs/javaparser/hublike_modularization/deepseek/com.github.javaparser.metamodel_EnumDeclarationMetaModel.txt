    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and one incoming dependency from EnumDeclaration. The JavaParserMetaModel dependency list is not a direct incoming dependency to EnumDeclarationMetaModel; it is a dependency of JavaParserMetaModel itself. Therefore, the total number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies is low, not indicating a hub-like structure."
