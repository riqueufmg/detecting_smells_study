    "justification": "The class has a high number of dependencies: 11 outgoing dependencies (e.g., ReturnStmt, FieldDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration) and 22 incoming dependencies from various classes (e.g., JavaSymbolSolver, JavaParserFacade, TypeExtractor). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
