    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LongLiteralExpr has only 7 outgoing dependencies (Range, Utils, LongLiteralExprMetaModel, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel) and 16 incoming dependencies from various visitor classes and other components. While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is not excessively large for a core AST node in a parser framework. The class serves as a leaf node in the expression hierarchy with limited outgoing coupling."
