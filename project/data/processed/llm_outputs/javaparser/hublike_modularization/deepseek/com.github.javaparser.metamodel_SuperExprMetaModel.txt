    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (SuperExpr and JavaParserMetaModel). The total number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies is low (3), which does not indicate a large number of dependencies typical of Hub-like Modularization."
