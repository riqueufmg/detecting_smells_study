    "justification": "The class has 10 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 29 dependencies. While this is a moderate number, it does not reach the threshold of being considered a 'large number' of dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for a core AST node class in a parser framework."
