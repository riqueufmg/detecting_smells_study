    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 outgoing dependencies and 17 incoming dependencies, resulting in a total of 29 dependencies with other abstractions. This large number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates the class acts as a hub, centralizing interactions with many other components."
