    "detection": false,
    "justification": "UnaryExpr has only 10 direct dependencies (outgoing) and is directly used by 19 incoming dependencies. While some of its dependencies (like Expression, Node, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, JavaParserMetaModel) have large dependency sets themselves, UnaryExpr itself does not have a large number of direct incoming and outgoing dependencies that would qualify as hub-like modularization."
