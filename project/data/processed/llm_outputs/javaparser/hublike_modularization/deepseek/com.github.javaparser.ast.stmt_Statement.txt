    "justification": "The class has 26 outgoing dependencies (including many concrete statement types, metamodels, and utility classes) and 17 incoming dependencies (from visitors, context classes, parsers, printers, and generators). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub in the system."
