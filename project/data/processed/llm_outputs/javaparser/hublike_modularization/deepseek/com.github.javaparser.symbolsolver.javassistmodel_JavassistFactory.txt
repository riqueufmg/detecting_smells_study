    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions (ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, AccessSpecifier, ResolvedVoidType, TypeSolver, ResolvedType) and incoming dependencies from 10 distinct abstractions (JarTypeSolver, JavassistEnumDeclaration, JavassistMethodDeclaration, JavassistInterfaceDeclaration, JavassistConstructorDeclaration, JavassistRecordDeclaration, JavassistFieldDeclaration, JavassistClassDeclaration, JavassistParameterDeclaration, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
