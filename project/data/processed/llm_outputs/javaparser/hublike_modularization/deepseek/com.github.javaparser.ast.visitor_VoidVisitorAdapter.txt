    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 100 different classes (as listed in the dependencies array), which constitutes a large number of outgoing dependencies. This meets the definition of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
