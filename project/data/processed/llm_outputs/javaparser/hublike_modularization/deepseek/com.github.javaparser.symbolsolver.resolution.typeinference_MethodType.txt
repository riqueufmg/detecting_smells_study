    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ResolvedType, MethodUsage) and 2 incoming dependencies (TypeHelper, ExpressionCompatibleWithType). This small number of dependencies does not indicate a hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
