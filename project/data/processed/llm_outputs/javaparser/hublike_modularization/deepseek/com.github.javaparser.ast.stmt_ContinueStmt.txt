    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 outgoing dependencies and 16 incoming dependencies, which does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies in either direction. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including base classes, visitors, metamodel components, and utility classes."
