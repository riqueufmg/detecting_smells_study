    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.TryStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 outgoing dependencies (Range, GenericVisitor, Node, BlockStmt, TryStmtMetaModel, TokenRange, NodeList, VoidVisitor, ObservableProperty, JavaParserMetaModel) and 16 incoming dependencies from various visitor classes and other components. While the incoming dependencies are numerous, they come from a limited set of abstraction types (visitors, printers, parsers, and context classes). The total number of distinct dependency relationships is not excessively large, and the class does not act as a central hub connecting a large number of diverse abstractions."
