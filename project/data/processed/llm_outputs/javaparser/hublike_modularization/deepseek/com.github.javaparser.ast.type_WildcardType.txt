    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 outgoing dependencies and 17 incoming dependencies, totaling 30 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including visitors, metamodel, resolution types, and base classes."
