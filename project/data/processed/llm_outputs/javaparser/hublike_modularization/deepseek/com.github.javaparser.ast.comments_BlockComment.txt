    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 outgoing dependencies and 14 incoming dependencies. While the incoming dependencies are somewhat numerous, the total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is not large enough to indicate a hub-like modularization. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
