    "justification": "The class has 12 outgoing dependencies (including GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, Node, etc.) and 31 incoming dependencies (including SourceFileInfoExtractor, JavaParserFacade, CompilationUnit, FieldDeclaration, BodyDeclaration, and numerous visitor classes). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub connecting many other abstractions."
