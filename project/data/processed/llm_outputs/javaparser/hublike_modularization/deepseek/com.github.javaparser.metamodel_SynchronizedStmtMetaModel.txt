    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and one incoming dependency (from SynchronizedStmt). The other incoming dependency is from JavaParserMetaModel, which depends on many classes, but that does not make SynchronizedStmtMetaModel a hub. The analyzed class itself has a low number of direct dependencies."
