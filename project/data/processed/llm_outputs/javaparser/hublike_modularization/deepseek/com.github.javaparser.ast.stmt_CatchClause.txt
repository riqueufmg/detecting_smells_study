    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.CatchClause",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 33 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not indicate an excessively large number of dependencies that would characterize a hub-like modularization. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including expected dependencies on core types (Node, Type, Parameter), visitor interfaces, and metamodel classes."
