    "justification": "The class has 9 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 28 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies that would characterize Hub-like Modularization, especially considering the class is part of a complex AST framework where moderate coupling is expected."
