    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (ResolvedType, InferenceVariable) and incoming dependencies from 6 abstractions (Bound, SubtypeOfBound, CapturesBound, SameAsBound, FalseBound, ThrowsBound), totaling 8 distinct dependencies. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
