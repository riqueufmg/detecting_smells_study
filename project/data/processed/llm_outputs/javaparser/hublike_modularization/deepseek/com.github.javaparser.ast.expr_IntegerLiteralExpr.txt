    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.IntegerLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 outgoing dependencies (Range, Utils, TokenRange, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, IntegerLiteralExprMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel) and 16 incoming dependencies from various visitors, printers, validators, and generators. While there are multiple incoming dependencies, the total number of distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is moderate, and the class does not exhibit an unusually large number of dependencies in both directions that would characterize a hub-like modularization smell."
