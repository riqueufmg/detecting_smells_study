    "justification": "The class has 9 outgoing dependencies and 17 incoming dependencies, totaling 26 dependencies. While this is a moderate number, it does not reach the threshold of 'large number of other abstractions' that characterizes Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for a node in an AST hierarchy."
