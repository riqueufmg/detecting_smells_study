    "justification": "The class has 12 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 31 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not indicate an excessively large number of dependencies that would characterize a hub-like modularization. The dependencies are typical for a node in an AST hierarchy, including base classes, visitors, and metamodel components."
