    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 outgoing dependencies and 19 incoming dependencies, totaling 28 dependencies. While not trivial, this number does not constitute a 'large number' of dependencies that would indicate Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are typical for an AST node class in a parser framework, including core framework classes (Node, Range, TokenRange), visitor interfaces, metamodel classes, and usage by various visitors and printers."
