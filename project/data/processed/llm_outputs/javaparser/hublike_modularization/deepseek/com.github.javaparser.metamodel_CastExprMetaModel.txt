    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (CastExpr and JavaParserMetaModel). This small number of dependencies (total of 3 distinct connections) does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate Hub-like Modularization."
