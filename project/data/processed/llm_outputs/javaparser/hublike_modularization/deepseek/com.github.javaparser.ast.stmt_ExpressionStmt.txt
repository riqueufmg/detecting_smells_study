    "justification": "The class has 9 outgoing dependencies (including Expression, Node, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, etc.) and 19 incoming dependencies (including DefaultVisitorAdapter, JavaParserFactory, BlockStmtContext, Statement, and multiple visitor classes). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub connecting many other abstractions."
