    "justification": "The class has zero outgoing dependencies and only three incoming dependencies (from JavaParserFacade, Node, and LexicalPreservingPrinter). This low number of total dependencies does not meet the threshold for a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
