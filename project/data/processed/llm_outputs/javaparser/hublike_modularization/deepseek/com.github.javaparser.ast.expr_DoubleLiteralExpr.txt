    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 outgoing dependencies and 15 incoming dependencies, which is not a large number of dependencies in either direction. The outgoing dependencies are typical utility classes (Range, TokenRange, visitors, metamodel), and the incoming dependencies are primarily from visitor implementations and utility classes that handle all AST node types generically, not specifically targeting DoubleLiteralExpr."
