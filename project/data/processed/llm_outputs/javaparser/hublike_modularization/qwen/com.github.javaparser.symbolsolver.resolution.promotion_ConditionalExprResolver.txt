    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ConditionalExprResolver' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The incoming dependency from 'TypeExtractor' includes a large number of dependencies (50+), indicating it is a hub-like class that interacts with many other abstractions. Additionally, 'ConditionalExprResolver' depends on 'ConditionalExprHandler', which itself has further outgoing dependencies, increasing the overall connectivity. This pattern of high incoming and outgoing dependency counts, both directly and indirectly, satisfies the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
