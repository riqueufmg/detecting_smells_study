    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.EmptyStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class EmptyStmt has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (20). The outgoing dependencies are focused on core meta-model and visitor classes, and the incoming dependencies, while numerous, are primarily from visitor and utility classes that operate on AST nodes. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the dependencies are not excessively widespread across unrelated abstractions."
