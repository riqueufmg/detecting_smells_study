    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.CompilationUnitContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CompilationUnitContext' has outgoing dependencies to 11 different classes across multiple packages, including 'Node', 'ClassOrInterfaceType', 'CompilationUnit', 'JavaParserFacade', 'MethodDeclaration', 'TypeSolver', 'Name', 'SymbolReference', 'ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration', 'MethodResolutionLogic', 'SymbolSolver', and 'ResolvedTypeDeclaration'. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it serves as a central context class in the symbolsolver module, likely coordinating interactions between various components, further supporting the presence of this smell."
