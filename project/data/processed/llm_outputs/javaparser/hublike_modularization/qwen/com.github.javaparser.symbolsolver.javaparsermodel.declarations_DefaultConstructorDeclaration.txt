    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.DefaultConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to AccessSpecifier, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, and ResolvedType. While ResolvedType itself has several dependencies, these are not counted as direct dependencies of DefaultConstructorDeclaration. The total number of direct dependencies (3 outgoing + 0 incoming = 3) is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies."
