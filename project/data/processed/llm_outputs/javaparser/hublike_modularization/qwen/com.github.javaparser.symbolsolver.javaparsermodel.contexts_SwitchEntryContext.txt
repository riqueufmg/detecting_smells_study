    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SwitchEntryContext' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Although there are no incoming dependencies, the extensive outgoing dependencies alone are sufficient to classify this as a hub-like module."
