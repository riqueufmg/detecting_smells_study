{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc.Javadoc",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.javadoc.Javadoc' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. The number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting multiple abstractions within the system. This high level of connectivity suggests Hub-like Modularization."
