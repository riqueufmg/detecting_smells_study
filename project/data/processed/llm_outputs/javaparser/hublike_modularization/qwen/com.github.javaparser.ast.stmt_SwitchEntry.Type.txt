    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SwitchEntry.Type",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from SwitchEntry class. The incoming dependencies show that SwitchEntry depends on SwitchEntry.Type (which is this class itself), but this represents a parent-child relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
