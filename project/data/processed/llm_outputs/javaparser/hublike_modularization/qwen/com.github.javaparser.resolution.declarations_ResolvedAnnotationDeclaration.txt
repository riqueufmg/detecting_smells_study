    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedAnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes across different packages, including JavaSymbolSolver, JavaParserFacade, AnnotationDeclaration, AnnotationExpr, and ResolvedTypeDeclaration. This indicates that a large number of other abstractions depend on this class, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
