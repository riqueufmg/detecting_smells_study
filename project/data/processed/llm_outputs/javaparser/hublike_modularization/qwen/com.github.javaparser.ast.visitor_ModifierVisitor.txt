    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ModifierVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ModifierVisitor' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (74 unique classes) across multiple packages, indicating it interacts with a wide range of abstractions. This extensive dependency pattern suggests hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other components."
