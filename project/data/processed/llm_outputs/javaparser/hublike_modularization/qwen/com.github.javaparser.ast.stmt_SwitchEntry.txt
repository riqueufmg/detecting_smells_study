    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SwitchEntry' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (38), indicating it interacts with many other classes. Its outgoing dependencies include core metamodel and AST classes such as 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'Node', 'GenericVisitor', 'SwitchEntryMetaModel', 'VoidVisitor', 'NodeList', 'TokenRange', 'Expression', and 'ObservableProperty'. Additionally, numerous other classes across different packages depend on 'SwitchEntry', including visitor implementations, symbol solvers, and generators. This extensive bidirectional dependency network classifies 'SwitchEntry' as hub-like in its modularization."
