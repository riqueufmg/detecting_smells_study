    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class JavaParserJsonSerializer. The incoming dependency shows the enclosing class uses this class but this does not indicate hub-like behavior as the class itself has minimal connections to other abstractions."
