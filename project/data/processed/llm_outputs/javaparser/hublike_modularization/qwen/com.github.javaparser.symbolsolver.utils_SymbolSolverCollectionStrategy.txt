    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ProjectRoot, ParserConfiguration, and CombinedTypeSolver, which are direct and limited in number. None of these dependencies indicate a large number of interactions or centralization of functionality that would characterize Hub-like Modularization."
