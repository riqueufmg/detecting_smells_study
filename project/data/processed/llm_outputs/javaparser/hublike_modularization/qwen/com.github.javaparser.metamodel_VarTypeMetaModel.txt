    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.VarTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.VarTypeMetaModel' has no outgoing dependencies but has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes, including 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel' which depends on 141 other classes. This indicates that VarTypeMetaModel acts as a hub with a large number of incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
