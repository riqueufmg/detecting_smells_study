    "class": "issue1945.implementations.WoolRenderer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (HairyAnimal and HairTypeWool) and 1 incoming dependency (HairTypeWool). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
