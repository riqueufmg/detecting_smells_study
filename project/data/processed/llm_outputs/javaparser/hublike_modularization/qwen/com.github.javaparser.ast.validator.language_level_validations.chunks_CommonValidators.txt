    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.CommonValidators",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CommonValidators' has outgoing dependencies to a large number of other abstractions (44 dependencies to various expression types in 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr', 4 dependencies to 'NodeList' related classes, and 1 dependency to 'NodeMetaModel'). This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class interacts with many different abstractions directly."
