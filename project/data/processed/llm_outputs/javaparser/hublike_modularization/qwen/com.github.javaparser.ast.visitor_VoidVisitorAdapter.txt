    "justification": "The class VoidVisitorAdapter has dependencies on 85 other classes, which indicates a large number of outgoing dependencies. Additionally, it is designed as a visitor adapter that typically interacts with many different node types in the AST, increasing both incoming and outgoing dependency potential. This high number of dependencies classifies it as hub-like modularization."
