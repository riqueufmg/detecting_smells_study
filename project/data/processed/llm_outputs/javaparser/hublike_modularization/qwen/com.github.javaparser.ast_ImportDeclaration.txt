    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.ImportDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ImportDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (24). It depends on multiple core classes such as 'Node', 'GenericVisitor', 'VoidVisitor', and meta-model classes like 'ImportDeclarationMetaModel'. Additionally, it is widely used by various visitors, parsers, and other components in the system (e.g., 'DefaultVisitorAdapter', 'CompilationUnit', 'JavaParser', 'StaticJavaParser', etc.). This extensive bidirectional dependency network indicates that 'ImportDeclaration' acts as a hub, connecting to numerous other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
