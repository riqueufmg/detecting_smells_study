    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (NodeList, StaticJavaParser, MetaModelGenerator) and incoming dependencies from 1 other class (NodeMetaModelGenerator). The dependencies involve a large number of abstractions both in outgoing (31 total dependencies across 3 classes) and incoming (16 dependencies from 1 class) directions, indicating hub-like modularization."
