    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedAnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to Expression) and 2 incoming dependencies (from JavaSymbolSolver and AnnotationMemberDeclaration). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
