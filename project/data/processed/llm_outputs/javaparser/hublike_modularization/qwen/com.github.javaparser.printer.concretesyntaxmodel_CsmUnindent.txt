    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmUnindent",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Node and SourcePrinter, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but the class CsmUnindent does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions. The lack of incoming dependencies also indicates it is not a hub-like module."
