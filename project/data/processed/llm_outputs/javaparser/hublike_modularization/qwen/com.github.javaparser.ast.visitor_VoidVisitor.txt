    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class VoidVisitor has a high number of outgoing dependencies (77) and incoming dependencies (64), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive connectivity suggests hub-like modularization, where VoidVisitor acts as a central point connecting many other components in the system."
