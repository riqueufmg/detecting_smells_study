    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CompilationUnitMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CompilationUnitMetaModel' has a high number of incoming dependencies, particularly from 'JavaParserMetaModel' which depends on 140 other classes, and 'CompilationUnit' which depends on 24 other classes. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'PropertyMetaModel', which itself has multiple dependencies. This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
