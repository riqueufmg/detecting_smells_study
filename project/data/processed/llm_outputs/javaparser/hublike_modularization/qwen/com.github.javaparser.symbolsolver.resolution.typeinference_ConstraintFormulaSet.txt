    "justification": "The class 'ConstraintFormulaSet' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes: 'TypeSolver', 'ConstraintFormula', and 'BoundSet'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 classes: 'TypeInference' and 'BoundSet'. This creates a total of 5 unique dependent classes, indicating a high number of bidirectional dependencies which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
