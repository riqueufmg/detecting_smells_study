    "justification": "The class 'Navigator' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 21 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Navigator' acts as a hub, connecting many different parts of the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
