    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.BodyDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'BodyDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (21) and incoming dependencies (8). It interacts with numerous other classes across different packages, including core AST classes like 'Node', 'NodeList', various declaration types (e.g., 'MethodDeclaration', 'FieldDeclaration', 'EnumDeclaration'), meta-model classes, and utility classes. This extensive web of dependencies indicates that 'BodyDeclaration' acts as a hub within the system, centralizing interactions with many other abstractions."
