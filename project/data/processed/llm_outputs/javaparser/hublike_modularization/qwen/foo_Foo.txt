```json
{
    "class": "foo.Foo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Foo has only 1 incoming dependency from foo.Main and 0 outgoing dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions."
}
