    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.EmptyStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'EmptyStmtMetaModel' has no outgoing dependencies and only two incoming dependencies from classes 'EmptyStmt' and 'JavaParserMetaModel'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and it does not exhibit hub-like modularization where a class has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
