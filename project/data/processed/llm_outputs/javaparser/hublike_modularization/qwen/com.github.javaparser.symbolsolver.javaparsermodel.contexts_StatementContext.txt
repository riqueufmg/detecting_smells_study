    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.StatementContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'StatementContext' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
