{
    "class": "foo.A",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class foo.A has only one outgoing dependency to foo.A.FindMeIfYouCan and one incoming dependency from foo.C. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
