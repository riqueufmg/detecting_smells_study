    "justification": "The class ResolvedUnionType has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (2) and incoming dependencies (2). It does not exhibit a high number of dependencies with other abstractions, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are focused and do not suggest that this class acts as a central hub connecting numerous other components."
