    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.PropagatingAstObserver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to NodeList, Node, AstObserver, and ObservableProperty. The incoming dependencies are from Node. This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as the number of dependencies is relatively low and not excessive in the context of software design."
