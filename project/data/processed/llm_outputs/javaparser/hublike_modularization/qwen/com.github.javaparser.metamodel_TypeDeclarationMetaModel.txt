    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeDeclarationMetaModel' has only one outgoing dependency to 'PropertyMetaModel' and two incoming dependencies from 'TypeDeclaration' and 'JavaParserMetaModel'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions."
