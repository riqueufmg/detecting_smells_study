    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.SymbolDeclarator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class SymbolDeclarator has incoming dependencies from 7 different classes, which indicates a high number of abstractions depending on it. Additionally, it appears in the dependencies list of multiple contexts and factory classes, suggesting it is a central abstraction that many other parts of the system depend on, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
