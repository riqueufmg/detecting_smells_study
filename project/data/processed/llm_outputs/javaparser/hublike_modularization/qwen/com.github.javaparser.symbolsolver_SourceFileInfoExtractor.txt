    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.SourceFileInfoExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SourceFileInfoExtractor' has outgoing dependencies to 12 different classes across multiple packages. Additionally, the dependencies it references, such as 'JavaParserFacade' and 'CompilationUnit', also have extensive outgoing dependencies, indicating that 'SourceFileInfoExtractor' interacts with a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This creates a hub-like structure where the class acts as a central point connecting to many other components."
