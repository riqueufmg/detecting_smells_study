    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.NodeGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'NodeGenerator' has outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes. Additionally, it depends on 'JavaParserMetaModel' which itself has a very large number of dependencies (85), indicating that 'NodeGenerator' indirectly interacts with a vast number of abstractions. The class also depends on 'CompilationUnit' which has 26 dependencies, further contributing to its hub-like characteristics. The combination of direct and indirect dependencies with a large number of abstractions confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
