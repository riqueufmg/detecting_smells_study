    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodDeclarationMetaModel' has a high number of incoming dependencies, particularly from 'JavaParserMetaModel' which depends on a large number of other classes, and also has outgoing dependencies to 'PropertyMetaModel'. This pattern of having many incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
