    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from class 'com.github.javaparser.ast.Node', which does not indicate a large number of dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires significant incoming and/or outgoing dependencies with many abstractions, which is not present here."
