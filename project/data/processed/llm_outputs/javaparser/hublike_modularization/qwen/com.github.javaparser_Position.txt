    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Position",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Position has only one outgoing dependency (Node) and is involved in incoming dependencies from 6 different classes. Although it has multiple incoming dependencies, the number of outgoing dependencies is minimal. Hub-like Modularization requires significant dependencies both incoming and outgoing, which is not the case here."
