{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TextElement' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and incoming dependencies from 10 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies (10) indicates that many abstractions depend on 'TextElement', which is a strong indicator of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, 'TextElement' is involved in dependencies with multiple classes across different packages, further supporting the presence of this smell."
