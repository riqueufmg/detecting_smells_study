    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VarType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class VarType has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (20). It depends on multiple core classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, ReferenceTypeImpl, NodeList, VarTypeMetaModel, TokenRange, ResolvedType, Expression, and Context. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor classes, adapter classes, and other components across the system, indicating central involvement in interactions. This extensive bidirectional dependency network qualifies as hub-like modularization."
