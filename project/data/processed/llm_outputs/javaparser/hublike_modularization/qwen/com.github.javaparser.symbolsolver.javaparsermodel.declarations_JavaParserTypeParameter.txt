    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserTypeParameter' has outgoing dependencies to 19 other classes, which indicates a high number of dependencies. This large number of outgoing dependencies suggests that the class interacts with many other abstractions, contributing to hub-like modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies, but the high outgoing dependency count alone is sufficient to qualify as a hub-like modularization smell."
