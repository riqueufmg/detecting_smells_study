    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to Utils class and no incoming dependencies. The Utils class itself has 4 dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for NodeWithIdentifier since it only interacts with one other abstraction directly."
