    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 different classes and incoming dependencies from 0 classes. Although there are no incoming dependencies, the high number of outgoing dependencies (connecting to various core and utility classes across different packages such as ast, symbolsolver, and resolution) indicates hub-like behavior where this class interacts with a wide range of other abstractions."
