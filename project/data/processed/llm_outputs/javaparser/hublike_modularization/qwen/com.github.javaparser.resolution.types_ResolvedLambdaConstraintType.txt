    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedLambdaConstraintType' has outgoing dependencies to 1 other class and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes. Additionally, it is involved in mutual dependencies with 'ResolvedType', which itself has multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies. This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
