    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class AbstractJavaParserContext has outgoing dependencies to 20 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that it acts as a hub, connecting various parts of the system. The class interacts with multiple core components such as JavaParserFacade, JavaParserFactory, MethodUsage, TypeSolver, and various AST expression classes, making it a central point of communication and coordination. This extensive dependency network classifies it as exhibiting Hub-like Modularization."
