    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodComparator' has outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes ('ClassComparator' and 'ParameterComparator') and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes ('ReflectionClassDeclaration' and 'ReflectionRecordDeclaration'), each with a large number of dependencies. This pattern of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
