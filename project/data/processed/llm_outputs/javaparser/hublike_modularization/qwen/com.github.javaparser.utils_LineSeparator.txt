    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator' has incoming dependencies from 20 different classes across multiple packages, including 'com.github.javaparser.ast.Node', 'com.github.javaparser.ParseResult', 'com.github.javaparser.JavaToken', and others. This indicates that a large number of abstractions depend on this class, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it has no outgoing dependencies, making it a central point that other classes rely on without depending on many others in return."
