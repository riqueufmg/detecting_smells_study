    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SimpleName",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class SimpleName has incoming dependencies from 97 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that SimpleName acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
