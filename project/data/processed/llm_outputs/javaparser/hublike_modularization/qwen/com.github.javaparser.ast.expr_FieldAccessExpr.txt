    "detection": true,
    "justification": "FieldAccessExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (44), indicating it is a central node in the system. It depends on core classes like VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, Node, Expression, and JavaParserMetaModel, and is depended upon by numerous visitor implementations, facade classes, and context classes across different packages. This extensive bidirectional dependency network suggests it acts as a hub in the modularization structure."
