    "justification": "The class BreakStmt has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (32). It is referenced by numerous visitor classes and other components across the system, and it also depends on a wide range of meta-model and AST classes. This bidirectional dependency with many abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
