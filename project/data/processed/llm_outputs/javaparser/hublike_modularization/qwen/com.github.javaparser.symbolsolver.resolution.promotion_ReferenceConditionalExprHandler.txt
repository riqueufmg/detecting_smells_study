    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.ReferenceConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple internal dependencies, but the ReferenceConditionalExprHandler class does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions nor is it depended upon by many other abstractions, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
