    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.ConcreteSyntaxModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ConcreteSyntaxModel' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes and incoming dependencies from 4 different classes. The total number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is 10, which is significantly high and indicates hub-like modularization. The class interacts with multiple other abstractions both directly and indirectly through its dependencies, making it a central hub in the module."
