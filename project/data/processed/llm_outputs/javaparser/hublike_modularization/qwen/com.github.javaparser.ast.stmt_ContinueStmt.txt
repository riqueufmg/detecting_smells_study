    "justification": "The class ContinueStmt has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (20). The dependencies are focused on core AST node functionality, visitor patterns, and metamodel classes. It does not exhibit hub-like characteristics as it doesn't connect to a large number of different abstractions or act as a central hub in the system architecture."
