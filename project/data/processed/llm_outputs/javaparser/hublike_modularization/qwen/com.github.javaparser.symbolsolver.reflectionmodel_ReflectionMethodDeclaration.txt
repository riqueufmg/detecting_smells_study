    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionMethodDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
