    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.UnknownType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'UnknownType' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 22 different classes. The outgoing dependencies include 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'GenericVisitor', 'VoidVisitor', 'NodeList', 'TokenRange', 'ResolvedType', 'Context', and 'UnknownTypeMetaModel'. The incoming dependencies originate from various visitor classes (e.g., 'GenericVisitor', 'VoidVisitor', 'HashCodeVisitor', etc.), adapter classes, and other components such as 'DefaultVisitorAdapter' and 'PrettyPrintVisitor'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'UnknownType' acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by numerous other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
