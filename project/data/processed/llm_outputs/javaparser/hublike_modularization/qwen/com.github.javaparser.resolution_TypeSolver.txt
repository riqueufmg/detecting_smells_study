{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeSolver' has incoming dependencies from 68 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions rely on 'TypeSolver', and the outgoing dependencies show that it interacts with multiple other abstractions. This pattern of having both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
