    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.RecordDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class RecordDeclaration has a large number of outgoing dependencies (11) and incoming dependencies (54). The outgoing dependencies include core infrastructure classes like JavaParserMetaModel, Node, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, NodeList, TokenRange, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, SimpleName, ObservableProperty, and RecordDeclarationMetaModel. The incoming dependencies come from a wide variety of classes across different packages including visitors (GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, HashCodeVisitor, etc.), symbol solvers, contexts, declarations, validators, parsers, and printers. This extensive bidirectional dependency network indicates that RecordDeclaration acts as a hub connecting many different parts of the system, which is the hallmark of Hub-like Modularization."
