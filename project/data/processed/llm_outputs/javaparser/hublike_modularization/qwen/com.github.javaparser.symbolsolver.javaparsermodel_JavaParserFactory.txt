    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserFactory' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes and incoming dependencies from 25 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, centralizing interactions between multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
