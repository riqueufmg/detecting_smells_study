{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.StringEscapeUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes, indicating it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. The class is depended upon by multiple external classes (TextBlockLiteralExpr, StringLiteralExpr, CharLiteralExpr) and also depends on inner classes (LookupTranslator, CharSequenceTranslator), showing bidirectional coupling with several abstractions."
