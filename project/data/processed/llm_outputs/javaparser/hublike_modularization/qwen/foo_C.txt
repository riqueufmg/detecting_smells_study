```json
{
    "class": "foo.C",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class foo.C has only one outgoing dependency to foo.A and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
