    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InstantiationSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'InstantiationSet' has outgoing dependencies to 'Instantiation', 'BoundSet', and 'ResolvedType'. It also has incoming dependencies from 'TypeInference' and 'BoundSet'. This indicates that 'InstantiationSet' is connected to a significant number of other abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
