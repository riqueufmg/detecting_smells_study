    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TypeParameterMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (TypeParameter and JavaParserMetaModel). While JavaParserMetaModel has many dependencies, the TypeParameterMetaModel itself does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in both directions. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not the case here."
