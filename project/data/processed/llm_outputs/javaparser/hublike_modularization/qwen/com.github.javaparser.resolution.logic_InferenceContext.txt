    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'InferenceContext' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes. The total number of dependencies (15) is significantly high, indicating that this class acts as a hub by interacting with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections. This central role in communication and coordination among various components justifies the detection of Hub-like Modularization."
