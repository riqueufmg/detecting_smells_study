    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeHelper' has both a high number of outgoing dependencies (15) and incoming dependencies (10). It interacts with numerous other classes across different packages, serving as a central point for type inference operations. This extensive interaction pattern, where 'TypeHelper' is both widely depended upon and depends on many other abstractions, indicates hub-like modularization."
