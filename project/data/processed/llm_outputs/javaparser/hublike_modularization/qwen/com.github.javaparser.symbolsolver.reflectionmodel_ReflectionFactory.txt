    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionFactory' has both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. It depends on 11 different classes in its outgoing dependencies and is depended upon by 15 different classes in its incoming dependencies. This high number of bidirectional dependencies indicates that 'ReflectionFactory' acts as a hub within the module, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
