    "detection": true,
    "justification": "MethodCallExpr has 14 outgoing dependencies and 24 incoming dependencies, indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This high number of bidirectional relationships classifies it as hub-like modularization."
