    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ConstructorDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (18) and incoming dependencies (54). The outgoing dependencies include core classes like 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'Node', 'GenericVisitor', 'VoidVisitor', and 'ResolvedConstructorDeclaration'. The incoming dependencies come from numerous classes across different packages, such as 'JavaSymbolSolver', 'DefaultVisitorAdapter', 'JavaParserFacade', multiple classes in 'declarations' and 'contexts' packages, and various visitor implementations. This extensive web of dependencies indicates that 'ConstructorDeclaration' acts as a hub within the system, connecting to many other abstractions both upstream and downstream, which is the hallmark of Hub-like Modularization."
