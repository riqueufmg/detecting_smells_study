    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'PropertyMetaModel' and two incoming dependencies from 'InitializerDeclaration' and 'JavaParserMetaModel'. The number of dependencies is not significantly high to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
