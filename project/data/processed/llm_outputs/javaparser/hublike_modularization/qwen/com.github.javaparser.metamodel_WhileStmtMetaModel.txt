{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.WhileStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'WhileStmtMetaModel' has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes ('WhileStmt' and 'JavaParserMetaModel') and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('PropertyMetaModel'). Although the number of direct dependencies is relatively low, the incoming dependency from 'JavaParserMetaModel' includes a very large number of dependencies (over 150), indicating that 'WhileStmtMetaModel' is part of a highly interconnected module. This pattern suggests hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point in the modular structure."
