{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.ThrowsBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from a single class (TypeInference). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
