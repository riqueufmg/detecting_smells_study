    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BreakStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (BreakStmt and JavaParserMetaModel). The number of dependencies is not significantly high to qualify as hub-like modularization, especially considering the context of meta-model classes which typically have limited and focused responsibilities."
