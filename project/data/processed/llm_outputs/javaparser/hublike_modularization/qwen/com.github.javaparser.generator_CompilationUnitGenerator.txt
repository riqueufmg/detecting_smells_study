    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.CompilationUnitGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to SourceRoot and CompilationUnit, each of which has multiple internal dependencies, but the CompilationUnitGenerator itself does not directly depend on those internal classes. The number of direct dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
