    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 5 other classes, which is not excessively high. There are no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies are from classes in different packages, but the number and nature of these dependencies do not indicate hub-like modularization. The class appears to be a relatively simple declaration interface with limited coupling."
