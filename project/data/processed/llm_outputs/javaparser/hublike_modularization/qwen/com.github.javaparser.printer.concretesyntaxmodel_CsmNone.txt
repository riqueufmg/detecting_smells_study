    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CsmNone has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Node and SourcePrinter) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and it does not exhibit hub-like behavior where a single class interacts with a large number of other abstractions."
