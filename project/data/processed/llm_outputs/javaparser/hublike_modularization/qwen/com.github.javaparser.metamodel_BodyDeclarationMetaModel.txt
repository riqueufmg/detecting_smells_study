{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BodyDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'BodyDeclarationMetaModel' has a high number of incoming dependencies, particularly from 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body.BodyDeclaration' and 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel', which depend on a large number of other classes. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'PropertyMetaModel', which also has multiple dependencies. This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies with many abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
