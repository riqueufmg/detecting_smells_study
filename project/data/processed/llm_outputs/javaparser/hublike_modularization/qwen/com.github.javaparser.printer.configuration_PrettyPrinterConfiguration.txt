    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'PrettyPrinterConfiguration' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (ConfigurationOption, Indentation, PrinterConfiguration, DefaultPrinterConfiguration) and incoming dependencies from 3 other abstractions (PrettyPrintVisitor, SourcePrinter, PrettyPrinter). This creates a hub-like structure where PrettyPrinterConfiguration acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependencies, satisfying the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
