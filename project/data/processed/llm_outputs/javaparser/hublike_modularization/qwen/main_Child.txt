{
    "class": "main.Child",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'main.Child' has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from 'main.Main'. The incoming dependency from Main includes three elements (NestedEnum, A, and Child itself), but this represents a single dependency relationship from one source class, not multiple dependencies from many different abstractions."
