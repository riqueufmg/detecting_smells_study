    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to StaticJavaParser (which itself has many dependencies but that is not counted for this class), NodeList, and ClassOrInterfaceType. The incoming dependency is from JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter. This is not a large number of dependencies relative to what would indicate hub-like modularization."
