    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The dependencies include JavaParserFactory, JavaParserFacade, SymbolDeclarator, TypeSolver, SymbolReference, and AbstractJavaParserContext. Among these, JavaParserFacade has a large number of outgoing dependencies (44), indicating it is a hub-like component. The analyzed class depends on multiple core components of the system, suggesting hub-like modularization."
