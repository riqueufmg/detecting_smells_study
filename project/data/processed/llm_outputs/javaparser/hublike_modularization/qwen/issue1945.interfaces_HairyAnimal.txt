    "class": "issue1945.interfaces.HairyAnimal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class HairyAnimal has only 1 outgoing dependency (to HairType) and 3 incoming dependencies (from WoolRenderer, MainIssue1945, HairTypeRenderer). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
