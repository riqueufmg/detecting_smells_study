    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.AcceptGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AcceptGenerator' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes: 'ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration', 'StaticJavaParser', 'MethodDeclaration', 'SourceRoot', 'CompilationUnit', and 'BaseNodeMetaModel'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 0 classes. The total number of dependencies (incoming + outgoing) is 6, which indicates a high number of interactions with other abstractions, suggesting hub-like modularization."
