    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'IntersectionType' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (23). It depends on multiple core classes such as 'ResolvedIntersectionType', 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'Node', 'GenericVisitor', 'VoidVisitor', and others. Additionally, it is referenced by numerous visitor classes and parser-related components, indicating central involvement in the system's type hierarchy and parsing logic. This extensive bidirectional dependency network classifies it as hub-like modularization."
