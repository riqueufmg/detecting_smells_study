    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.BooleanConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to ResolvedType and no incoming dependencies. While ResolvedType itself has multiple dependencies (7 outgoing), the BooleanConditionalExprHandler class in isolation only maintains a single dependency relationship, which does not constitute a hub-like pattern with a large number of direct dependencies."
