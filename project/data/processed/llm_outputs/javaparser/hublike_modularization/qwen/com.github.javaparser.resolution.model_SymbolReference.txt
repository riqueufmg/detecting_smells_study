    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SymbolReference' has incoming dependencies from 68 other classes across multiple packages, including 'JavaSymbolSolver', 'SourceFileInfoExtractor', 'SymbolResolutionCapability', numerous classes in 'reflectionmodel', 'javaparsermodel', 'declarations', 'contexts', 'typesolvers', 'typeinference', 'naming', 'resolution', 'javassistmodel', 'ast.type', 'resolution', and 'logic'. This high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions rely on 'SymbolReference', making it a central hub in the system. Additionally, it has no outgoing dependencies, which further supports its role as a hub-like abstraction that is depended upon but does not depend on others."
