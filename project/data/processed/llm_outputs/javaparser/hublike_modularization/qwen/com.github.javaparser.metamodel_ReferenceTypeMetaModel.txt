    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ReferenceTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReferenceTypeMetaModel' has no outgoing dependencies but has incoming dependencies from two other classes, one of which is 'JavaParserMetaModel' that depends on a large number of other abstractions (over 150 dependencies listed). This indicates that 'ReferenceTypeMetaModel' acts as a hub in the modularization structure due to its central role being referenced by highly connected classes."
