    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from SourceZip class. The incoming dependency list shows only one source (SourceZip) with 4 dependencies including this class, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependency connections."
