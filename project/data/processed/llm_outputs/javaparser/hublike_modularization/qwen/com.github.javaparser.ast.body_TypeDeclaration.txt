    "justification": "The class 'TypeDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (13) and incoming dependencies (15). It interacts with numerous other classes across different packages, including 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'Node', 'BodyDeclaration', 'CallableDeclaration', and various meta-model and expression classes. This extensive web of dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, indicates that 'TypeDeclaration' acts as a central hub, which is the hallmark of Hub-like Modularization."
