    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TypeMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeMetaModel has incoming dependencies from 2 classes ('com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type' and 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel') and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel'). The incoming dependency from 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel' includes a very large number of dependencies (over 100), indicating that TypeMetaModel is centrally involved in interactions with numerous other abstractions, both in terms of being a dependency for many classes and depending on others. This central role with extensive incoming and outgoing connections justifies the classification as Hub-like Modularization."
