    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'InferenceVariable' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes and incoming dependencies from 10 classes. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions depend on this class, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, its outgoing dependencies connect to foundational types in the type resolution system, suggesting it acts as a central point in the type inference mechanism."
