    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor' has dependencies on 134 other classes, which indicates a high number of outgoing dependencies. This large number of dependencies suggests that the class interacts with many other abstractions, making it a hub-like module. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies listed, but the high outgoing dependency count alone is sufficient to classify it as Hub-like Modularization."
