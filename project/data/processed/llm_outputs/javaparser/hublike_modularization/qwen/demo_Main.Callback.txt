    "class": "demo.Main.Callback",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot) and 1 incoming dependency (from demo.Main). The outgoing dependency has multiple sub-dependencies, but these are dependencies of the SourceRoot class, not direct dependencies of Main.Callback. The class does not show hub-like behavior as it has very limited direct connections to other abstractions."
