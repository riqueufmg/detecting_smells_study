    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.EnclosedExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class EnclosedExpr has incoming dependencies from 27 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 9 classes. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other classes depend on EnclosedExpr, and the outgoing dependencies show that EnclosedExpr interacts with a wide variety of other classes. This pattern of having many incoming and outgoing connections suggests hub-like modularization."
