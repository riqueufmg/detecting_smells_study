    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Expression' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (49) and incoming dependencies (94), indicating it is connected to a large number of other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This extensive connectivity suggests hub-like modularization where 'Expression' acts as a central point interacting with many other components in the system."
