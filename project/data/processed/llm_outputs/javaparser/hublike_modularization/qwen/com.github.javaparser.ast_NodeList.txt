    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class NodeList has outgoing dependencies on a large number of classes (4 classes listed in 'dependencies' array within 'analyzed_package'), and it's also involved in numerous incoming dependencies from many other classes across different packages. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that NodeList acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
