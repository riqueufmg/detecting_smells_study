    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NodeWithArguments has only 3 outgoing dependencies (StaticJavaParser, NodeList, Expression) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
