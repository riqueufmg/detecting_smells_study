    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CompactConstructorDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (CompactConstructorDeclaration and JavaParserMetaModel). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, where a class would have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
