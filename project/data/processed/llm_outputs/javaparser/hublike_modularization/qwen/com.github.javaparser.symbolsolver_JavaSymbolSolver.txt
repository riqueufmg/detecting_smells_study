    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaSymbolSolver' has outgoing dependencies to 26 other classes and 1 inner class ('ArrayLengthValueDeclaration'), and it also has incoming dependencies from at least one other class ('JavaParserFacade' which lists 30 dependencies including 'JavaSymbolSolver'). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'JavaSymbolSolver' acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
