    "justification": "The class CsmMix has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (Node and SourcePrinter), which in turn have dependencies to 26 and 5 other classes respectively. Additionally, CsmMix has incoming dependencies from 4 classes (LexicalDifferenceCalculator, LexicalPreservingPrinter, ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor, and Reshuffled), which together depend on 34 other classes. This creates a hub-like structure where CsmMix is central to a large number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
