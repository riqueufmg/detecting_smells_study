    "justification": "FieldDeclaration has a high number of outgoing dependencies (18) and incoming dependencies (60+), indicating it interacts with numerous other classes. This extensive connectivity, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, suggests a hub-like role in the system architecture."
