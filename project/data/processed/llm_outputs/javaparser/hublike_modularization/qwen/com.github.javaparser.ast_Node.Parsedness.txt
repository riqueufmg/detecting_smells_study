    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the class 'com.github.javaparser.ast.Node', which itself has many dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
