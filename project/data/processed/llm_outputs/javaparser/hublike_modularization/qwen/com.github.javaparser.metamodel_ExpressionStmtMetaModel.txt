    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (from ExpressionStmt and JavaParserMetaModel). While JavaParserMetaModel shows many dependencies, the ExpressionStmtMetaModel itself does not directly depend on or connect to a large number of other abstractions. The dependencies are limited and do not indicate hub-like modularization."
