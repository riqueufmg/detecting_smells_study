    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class HashCodeVisitor has outgoing dependencies to 98 different classes across various packages, indicating it interacts with a large number of abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from the Node class, which itself has a wide range of dependencies. This pattern of both high outgoing and incoming dependencies with numerous abstractions confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
