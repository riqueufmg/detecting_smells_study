    "justification": "The class 'ProperUpperBound' has only outgoing dependencies to two other classes ('InferenceVariable' and 'ResolvedType') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous connections to other abstractions in the provided data."
