    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.quality.NotNullGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class NotNullGenerator has outgoing dependencies to 10 different classes across multiple packages. Additionally, the dependencies it references, such as StaticJavaParser and CompilationUnit, themselves have extensive outgoing dependencies, indicating that NotNullGenerator interacts with a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly. This creates a hub-like modularization smell due to the high number of dependencies."
