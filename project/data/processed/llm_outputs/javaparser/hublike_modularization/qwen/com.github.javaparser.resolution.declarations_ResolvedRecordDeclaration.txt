    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedRecordDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ResolvedTypeDeclaration. The incoming dependency shows that ResolvedTypeDeclaration has dependencies on multiple classes including this one, but this does not indicate that ResolvedRecordDeclaration itself has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The class appears to be a leaf node in the dependency structure with minimal connectivity."
