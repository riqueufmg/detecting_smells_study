    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class XmlPrinter has only outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (NodeList, NodeMetaModel, Node, Utils) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. None of the outgoing dependencies show extensive dependency chains that would suggest the class is acting as a hub."
