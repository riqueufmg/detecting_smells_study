    "justification": "The class IfStmt has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (44). It interacts with numerous classes across different packages, such as com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor, and many others. This extensive web of dependencies indicates that IfStmt acts as a hub within the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
