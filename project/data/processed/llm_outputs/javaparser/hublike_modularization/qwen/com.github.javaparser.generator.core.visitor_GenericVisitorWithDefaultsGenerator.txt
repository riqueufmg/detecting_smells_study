{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.GenericVisitorWithDefaultsGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 different classes, each of which also has multiple dependencies. Specifically, MethodDeclaration has 23 dependencies, CompilationUnit has 26 dependencies, BlockStmt has 9 dependencies, SourceRoot has 9 dependencies, and BaseNodeMetaModel has 3 dependencies. This indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions both directly and indirectly, creating a hub-like modularization smell."
