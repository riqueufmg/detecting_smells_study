    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.NameMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class NameMetaModel has incoming dependencies from a large number of other abstractions (e.g., Name, JavaParserMetaModel with 100+ dependencies) and outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions including PropertyMetaModel which itself has further dependencies. This creates a hub-like structure where NameMetaModel acts as a central point connecting numerous other classes."
