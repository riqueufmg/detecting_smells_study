    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.SynchronizedStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (SynchronizedStmt and JavaParserMetaModel). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
