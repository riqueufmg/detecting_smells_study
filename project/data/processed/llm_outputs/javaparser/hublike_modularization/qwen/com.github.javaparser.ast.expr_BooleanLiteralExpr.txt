    "justification": "The class BooleanLiteralExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5 direct dependencies) and incoming dependencies (primarily from visitor and utility classes). The dependencies are focused on core AST expression handling and visitor patterns, which is expected for a leaf expression class in an AST. It does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it does not connect to a large number of diverse abstractions."
