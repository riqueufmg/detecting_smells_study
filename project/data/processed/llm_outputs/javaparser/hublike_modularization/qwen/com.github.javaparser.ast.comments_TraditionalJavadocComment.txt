    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TraditionalJavadocComment has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (7) and incoming dependencies (19), which does not indicate an excessive number of connections. The dependencies are focused on related classes in the visitor, metamodel, and javadoc packages, suggesting a cohesive role rather than being a hub. There is no evidence of it acting as a central point connecting to a large number of unrelated abstractions."
