    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (ResolvedType, Expression, TypeSolver, SymbolReference) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization, and there is no evidence of the class being a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections."
