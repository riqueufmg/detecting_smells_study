    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Removed' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (2). The outgoing dependencies are to 'CsmToken', 'Node', 'CsmElement', and 'LexicalDifferenceCalculator'. The incoming dependencies are from 'Difference' and 'RemovedGroup'. While it interacts with several other classes, the number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no indication that it acts as a central hub coordinating a vast number of interactions. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
