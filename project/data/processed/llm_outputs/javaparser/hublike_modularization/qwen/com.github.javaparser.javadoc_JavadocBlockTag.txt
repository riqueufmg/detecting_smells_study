    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (2). The outgoing dependencies are to JavadocDescription, Utils, and JavadocBlockTag.Type. The incoming dependencies are from JavadocParser and Javadoc. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show excessive or centralizing dependency relationships."
