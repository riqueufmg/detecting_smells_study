    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorSet' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (74) to various classes in the 'com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor' package, indicating it interacts with a large number of abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from at least one other class ('VisitorSet.EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade'), showing bidirectional coupling. This pattern of having many dependencies both incoming and outgoing confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
