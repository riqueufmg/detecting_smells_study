{
    "class": "com.example.Beta",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.example.Alpha and com.example.Beta.CustomInterface) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, not indicating hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
