    "justification": "The class JavaParserMetaModel has a large number of outgoing dependencies (79) and incoming dependencies (141), indicating it interacts with a vast number of other abstractions, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This extensive bidirectional dependency network is a hallmark of Hub-like Modularization, where the class acts as a central hub connecting numerous other components."
