    "class": "com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer.JsonRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from JavaParserJsonSerializer class. The incoming dependency count (1) and outgoing dependency count (0) are both low, not indicating hub-like modularization where there would be dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
