    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LiteralExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class LiteralExpr has outgoing dependencies to 4 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (Expression). The outgoing dependencies include JavaParserMetaModel which itself has a large number of dependencies (80+), indicating that LiteralExpr is connected to a wide range of abstractions through this hub-like dependency. Additionally, the incoming dependency from Expression shows that LiteralExpr is also a dependency for a class that connects to many other expressions, further reinforcing its role in a hub-like modularization pattern."
