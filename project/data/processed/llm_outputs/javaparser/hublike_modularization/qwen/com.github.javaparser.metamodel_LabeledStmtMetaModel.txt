    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.LabeledStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (LabeledStmt and JavaParserMetaModel). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies in both directions."
