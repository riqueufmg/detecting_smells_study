    "justification": "The class TextElementMatcher has a limited number of dependencies. It has 1 outgoing dependency to TextElement and 3 incoming dependencies from NodeText, TextElement, and TextElementMatchers. This is not a large number of dependencies, and therefore does not qualify as Hub-like Modularization."
