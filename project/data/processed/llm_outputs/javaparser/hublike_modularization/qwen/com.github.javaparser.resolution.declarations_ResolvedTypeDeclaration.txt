    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedTypeDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes within the same package and is referenced by 20 incoming dependencies from various classes across different packages. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a central hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
