    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserSymbolDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (13) and incoming dependencies (11). It interacts with numerous other classes across different packages, both in terms of using them (outgoing) and being used by them (incoming). This pattern of having many dependencies in both directions indicates hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
