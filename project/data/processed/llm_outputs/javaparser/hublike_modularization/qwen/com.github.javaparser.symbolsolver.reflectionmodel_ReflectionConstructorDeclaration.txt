    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionConstructorDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 7 distinct classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class ('ReflectionTypeParameter'). It directly interacts with core abstractions such as 'ResolvedType', 'TypeSolver', 'ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration', and 'ReflectionFactory', which themselves have further dependencies. The class serves as a central point connecting multiple key abstractions in the system, indicating hub-like behavior due to its high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
