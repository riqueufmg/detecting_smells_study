    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedMethodDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('ResolvedType') and incoming dependencies from 16 different classes. This high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other abstractions depend on this class, which is a key indicator of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, while its outgoing dependencies are limited, the significant incoming dependency count confirms that this abstraction acts as a central hub in the system architecture."
