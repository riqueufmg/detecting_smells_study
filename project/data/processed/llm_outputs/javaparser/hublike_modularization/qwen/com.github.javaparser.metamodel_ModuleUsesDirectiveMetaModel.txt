    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (ModuleUsesDirective and JavaParserMetaModel). The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
