    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (SwitchExpr and JavaParserMetaModel). This is not a large number of dependencies, and the pattern of having a single outgoing dependency and a few incoming dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization."
