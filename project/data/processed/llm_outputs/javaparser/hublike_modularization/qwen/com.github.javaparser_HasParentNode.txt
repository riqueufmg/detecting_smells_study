    "justification": "The class HasParentNode has only one outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.ast.Node and no incoming dependencies. The large number of dependencies (21) belongs to the Node class, not to HasParentNode itself. For Hub-like Modularization to be detected, the class in question must have many direct dependencies itself, which is not the case here."
