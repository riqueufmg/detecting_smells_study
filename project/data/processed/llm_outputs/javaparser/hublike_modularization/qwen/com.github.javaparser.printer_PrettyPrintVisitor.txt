    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrintVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class PrettyPrintVisitor has a high number of outgoing dependencies (77 unique classes) and no incoming dependencies. The large number of outgoing dependencies indicates that it interacts with many other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. This class likely serves as a central point for printing various AST node types, leading to dependencies on a wide range of classes from different packages such as com.github.javaparser.ast.body, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt, and others. The absence of incoming dependencies suggests it is not being reused or extended by other parts of the system, further supporting its role as a hub that centralizes interactions rather than being a reusable component."
