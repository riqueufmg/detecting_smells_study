    "justification": "The class CsmAttribute has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and only one incoming dependency from LexicalDifferenceCalculator. The dependencies are focused within related packages (ast, printer, concretesyntaxmodel) and do not indicate a hub-like structure where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of unrelated abstractions."
