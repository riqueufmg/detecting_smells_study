{
    "class": "main.Main",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (main.Main.NestedEnum, main.A, main.Child) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
