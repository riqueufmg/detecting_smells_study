    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithMembers",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'NodeWithMembers' has outgoing dependencies to 12 different classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class ('AstResolutionUtils'). The outgoing dependencies span multiple packages including 'com.github.javaparser.ast.type', 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body', 'com.github.javaparser.ast', 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr', 'com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt', and 'com.github.javaparser'. This wide range of dependencies indicates that 'NodeWithMembers' interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
