    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.FieldAccessContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'FieldAccessContext' has outgoing dependencies to 12 different classes across multiple packages. It interacts with various core abstractions such as 'FieldAccessExpr', 'JavaParserFacade', 'ResolvedType', 'TypeSolver', and others. This wide range of dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
