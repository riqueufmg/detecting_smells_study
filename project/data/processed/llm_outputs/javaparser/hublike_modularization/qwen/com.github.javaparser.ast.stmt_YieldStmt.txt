    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class YieldStmt has a high number of outgoing dependencies (8) and incoming dependencies (24). It depends on multiple core classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, YieldStmtMetaModel, TokenRange, Expression, and ObservableProperty. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor classes and other components across the system, indicating it acts as a hub in the modularization structure."
