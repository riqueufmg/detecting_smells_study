    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.Visitable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Visitable' has outgoing dependencies to 'VoidVisitor' and 'GenericVisitor'. Both of these visitor classes have a large number of outgoing dependencies, each depending on numerous classes across different packages. Additionally, 'Visitable' has incoming dependencies from multiple visitor implementations such as 'ModifierVisitor', 'ObjectIdentityEqualsVisitor', 'EqualsVisitor', 'NoCommentEqualsVisitor', 'CloneVisitor', and printer classes like 'PrettyPrintVisitor' and 'DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor'. These incoming dependencies also exhibit a wide range of outgoing dependencies, indicating that 'Visitable' acts as a central hub connecting various parts of the system through its role in the visitor pattern."
