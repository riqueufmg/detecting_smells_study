    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.Substitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Substitution' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 2 incoming dependencies from other classes. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies to and from many other abstractions."
