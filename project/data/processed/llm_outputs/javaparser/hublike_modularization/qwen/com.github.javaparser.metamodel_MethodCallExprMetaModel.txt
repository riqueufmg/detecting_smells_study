    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.MethodCallExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (MethodCallExpr and JavaParserMetaModel). While JavaParserMetaModel shows a large number of dependencies, the MethodCallExprMetaModel itself does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies in either direction. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have many dependencies both incoming and outgoing, which is not the case here."
