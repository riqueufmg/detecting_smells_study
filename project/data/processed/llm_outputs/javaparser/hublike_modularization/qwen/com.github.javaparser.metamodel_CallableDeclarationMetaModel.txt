    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CallableDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CallableDeclarationMetaModel' has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes ('CallableDeclaration' and 'JavaParserMetaModel') and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('PropertyMetaModel'). While the outgoing dependency count is low, the incoming dependency count is relatively high, especially considering that 'JavaParserMetaModel' depends on a very large number of meta-model classes (50+), indicating that 'CallableDeclarationMetaModel' acts as a central point in the meta-model structure. This pattern of being a central dependency hub qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
