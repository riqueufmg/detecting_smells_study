    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java17Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ParserConfiguration and Validator) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies show moderate coupling but do not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
