{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Validator class has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (ProblemReporter and Node), and incoming dependencies from 15 classes. The high number of incoming dependencies (>=10) indicates that many other abstractions depend on it, which is a strong indicator of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the class is involved in numerous inter-class relationships both in terms of usage (outgoing) and being used (incoming), reinforcing its role as a central hub in the module."
