{
    "class": "javaparser.GenericClass.Foo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class GenericClass. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
