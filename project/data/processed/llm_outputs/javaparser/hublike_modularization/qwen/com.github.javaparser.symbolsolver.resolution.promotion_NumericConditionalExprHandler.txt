    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.NumericConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ResolvedType and ResolvedPrimitiveType, which are core types in the resolution system. While ResolvedType itself has several dependencies, this does not indicate hub-like behavior for NumericConditionalExprHandler, as it directly depends on only two abstractions and is not depended upon by any other classes."
