    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.LazyType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'LazyType' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates that 'LazyType' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
