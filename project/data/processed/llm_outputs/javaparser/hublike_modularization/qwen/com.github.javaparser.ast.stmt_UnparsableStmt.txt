    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class UnparsableStmt has a relatively small number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It depends on 5 other classes and is depended upon by 20 classes. The dependencies are focused mainly on core AST node types, visitor patterns, and meta-model classes. This is not excessive enough to qualify as Hub-like Modularization, which typically involves a large number of diverse dependencies indicating a central, over-connected role in the system."
