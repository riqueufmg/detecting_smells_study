    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CsmToken has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes and incoming dependencies from 5 different classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes like Node and SourcePrinter, and the incoming dependencies come from multiple classes in the lexical preservation package, indicating it acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies across different packages confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
