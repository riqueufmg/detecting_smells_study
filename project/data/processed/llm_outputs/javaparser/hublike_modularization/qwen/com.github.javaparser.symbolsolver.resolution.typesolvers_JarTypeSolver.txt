    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JarTypeSolver has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include core resolution classes such as TypeSolver, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, and UnsolvedSymbolException, indicating it interacts with fundamental parts of the type resolution system. The incoming dependencies show that multiple type solvers (TypeSolverBuilder and AarTypeSolver) depend on it, making it a central component in the type solving architecture. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies across different packages indicates hub-like behavior where JarTypeSolver acts as a central coordinator or hub for type resolution functionality."
