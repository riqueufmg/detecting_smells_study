    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.NoChange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'NoChange' has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Node and ObservableProperty) and 3 incoming dependencies from closely related change classes (ListAdditionChange, ListRemovalChange, ListReplacementChange). The total number of dependencies is relatively low, and they are confined to a small set of related abstractions within the same package, which does not indicate hub-like modularization."
