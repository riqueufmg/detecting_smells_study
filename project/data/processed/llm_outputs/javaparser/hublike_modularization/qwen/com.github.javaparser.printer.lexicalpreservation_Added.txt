    "justification": "The class 'Added' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). It does not exhibit a high number of interactions with other abstractions, which would be indicative of Hub-like Modularization. The dependencies are focused within the same package and do not span across a large number of different modules or classes."
