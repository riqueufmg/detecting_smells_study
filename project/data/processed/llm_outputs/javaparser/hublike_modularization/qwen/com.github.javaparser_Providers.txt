    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (Provider) and is involved in incoming dependencies from two classes (JavaParser and ParserConfiguration). The number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub with numerous connections to many other abstractions."
