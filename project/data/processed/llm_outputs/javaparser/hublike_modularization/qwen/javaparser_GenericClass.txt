    "class": "javaparser.GenericClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'javaparser.GenericClass.Foo' and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
