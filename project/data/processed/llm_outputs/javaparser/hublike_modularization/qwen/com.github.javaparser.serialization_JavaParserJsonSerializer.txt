    "class": "com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserJsonSerializer' has outgoing dependencies to 11 different abstractions. Additionally, it contains inner classes (JsonTokenRange, JsonToken, JsonNode, JsonRange) which are also part of its dependencies, indicating a high degree of coupling. The class interacts with core abstractions such as 'Node', 'NodeList', 'JavaParserMetaModel', and 'BaseNodeMetaModel', which themselves have extensive dependency networks, further contributing to the hub-like characteristic. The large number of outgoing dependencies, combined with the presence of multiple inner classes that are also dependencies, confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
