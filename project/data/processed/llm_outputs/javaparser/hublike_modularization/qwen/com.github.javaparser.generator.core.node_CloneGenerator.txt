    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.CloneGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CloneGenerator' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes: 'ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration', 'StaticJavaParser', 'MethodDeclaration', 'SourceRoot', 'CompilationUnit', and 'BaseNodeMetaModel'. Additionally, 'StaticJavaParser' itself has dependencies to 24 other classes, 'CompilationUnit' has dependencies to 26 other classes, and 'ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration' has dependencies to 11 other classes. This indicates that 'CloneGenerator' is connected to a large number of abstractions both directly and indirectly through its dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
