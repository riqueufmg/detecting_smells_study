    "justification": "The class LexicalDifferenceCalculator has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes and incoming dependencies from 8 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting multiple parts of the system. Specifically, it interacts with various concrete syntax model elements (e.g., CsmElement, CsmConditional, CsmSequence), lexical preservation components (e.g., NodeText, Difference, DifferenceElement), and core AST nodes (e.g., Node, NodeList, ObservableProperty). This extensive dependency network suggests Hub-like Modularization."
