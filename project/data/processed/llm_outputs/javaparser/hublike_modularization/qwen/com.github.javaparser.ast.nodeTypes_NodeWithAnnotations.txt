    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithAnnotations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'NodeWithAnnotations' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include 'SingleMemberAnnotationExpr', 'NormalAnnotationExpr', 'NodeList', 'Expression', 'AnnotationExpr', 'StaticJavaParser', and 'MarkerAnnotationExpr'. The incoming dependencies come from 'AstResolutionUtils' and 'VoidVisitorAdapter'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
