    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes: 'ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration', 'ResolvedFieldDeclaration', 'ResolvedMethodDeclaration', 'ResolvedTypeDeclaration', 'ResolvedParameterDeclaration', and 'ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration'. This indicates that 'ResolvedDeclaration' interacts with a large number of other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
