    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ComponentPatternExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (4). The outgoing dependencies are to ComponentPatternExprMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel, and TokenRange. The incoming dependencies come from PatternVariableVisitor, AbstractJavaParserContext, Expression, and GeneratedJavaParser. While JavaParserMetaModel itself has many dependencies, this does not directly indicate that ComponentPatternExpr is hub-like. The class does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies in either direction, which would be characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
