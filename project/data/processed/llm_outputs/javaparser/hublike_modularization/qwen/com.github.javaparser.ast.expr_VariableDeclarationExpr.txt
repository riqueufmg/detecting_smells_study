    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class VariableDeclarationExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (58). It depends on various core classes such as VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, Node, Type, and Modifier, indicating it interacts with multiple parts of the system. Additionally, it is referenced by numerous visitor implementations, context classes, and other expression types, showing widespread usage across the codebase. This pattern of having many incoming and outgoing connections classifies it as a hub-like module."
