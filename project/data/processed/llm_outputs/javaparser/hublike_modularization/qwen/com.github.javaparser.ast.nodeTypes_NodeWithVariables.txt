    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithVariables",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class NodeWithVariables has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type which itself has dependencies to 20 other classes, and com.github.javaparser.ast.body.VariableDeclarator which has dependencies to 18 other classes. The incoming dependencies include com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrintVisitor which has dependencies to 134 other classes. This pattern of both high outgoing and high incoming dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
