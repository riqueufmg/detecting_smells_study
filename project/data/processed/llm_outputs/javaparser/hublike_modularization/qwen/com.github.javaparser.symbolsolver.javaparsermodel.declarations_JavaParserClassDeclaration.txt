    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserClassDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserClassDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 18 different classes across multiple packages, including 'com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type', 'com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ClassOrInterfaceType', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFactory', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade', and others. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it has no incoming dependencies, meaning it is not a central point for other classes to depend on, but its extensive outgoing connections still qualify it as a hub-like module."
