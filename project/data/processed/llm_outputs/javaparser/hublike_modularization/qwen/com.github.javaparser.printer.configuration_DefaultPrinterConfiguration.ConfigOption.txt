{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.DefaultPrinterConfiguration.ConfigOption",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to LineSeparator and 1 incoming dependency from DefaultPrinterConfiguration. The number of dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
