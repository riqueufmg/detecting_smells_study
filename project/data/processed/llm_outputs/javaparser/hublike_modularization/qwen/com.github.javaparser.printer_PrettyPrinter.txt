    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The PrettyPrinter class exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive outgoing dependencies. It directly depends on 5 classes, and through these dependencies, it connects to a large number of other abstractions. For example, its dependency on VoidVisitor includes 100+ direct dependencies, and its dependency on Node includes 20+ dependencies. This creates a central point of coupling with many other parts of the system, both in terms of direct dependencies and transitive relationships, making it a hub that many components depend on or that depends on many components."
