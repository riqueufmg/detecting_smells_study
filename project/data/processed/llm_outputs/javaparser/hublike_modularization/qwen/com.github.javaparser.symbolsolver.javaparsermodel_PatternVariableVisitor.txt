    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.PatternVariableVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'PatternVariableVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes. The total number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is 14, which indicates a high level of connectivity. This significant number of dependencies suggests that 'PatternVariableVisitor' acts as a hub, interacting with a large number of other abstractions, thus qualifying as Hub-like Modularization."
