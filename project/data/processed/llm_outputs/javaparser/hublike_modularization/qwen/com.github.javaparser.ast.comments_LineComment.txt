    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class LineComment has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (24). The dependencies are primarily related to core AST visitor patterns and meta-model classes, which is typical for a comment node in a parser library. The number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization."
