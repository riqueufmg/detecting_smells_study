    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.ReflectionTypeSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionTypeSolver' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('ModuleLayerHelper' and 'ReflectionFactory') and incoming dependencies from 2 classes ('TypeSolverBuilder' and 'TypeCompatibleWithType'). Additionally, 'ReflectionFactory', one of its outgoing dependencies, has further dependencies on 11 other abstractions. This creates a hub-like structure where 'ReflectionTypeSolver' acts as a central point connecting to multiple abstractions directly and indirectly."
