    "justification": "The class CsmComment has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to Comment, Node, and SourcePrinter, and the incoming dependency is from CsmOrphanCommentsEnding. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show a large number of interactions with other abstractions."
