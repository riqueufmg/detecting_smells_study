    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ObjectCreationExpr has a large number of outgoing dependencies (14) and incoming dependencies (44). It depends on various core classes such as VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, Node, NodeList, Type, and others. Additionally, it is referenced by numerous visitor classes, facade classes, and other components across different packages, indicating that it is a central class with high connectivity. This extensive dependency network, both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
