    "justification": "The class 'Change' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'CsmConditional', 'ObservableProperty', 'Node', and 'Utils'. The only incoming dependency is from 'LexicalDifferenceCalculator'. This level of dependency does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show a large number of interactions with other abstractions."
