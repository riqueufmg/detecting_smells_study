    "justification": "The class DataKey has no outgoing dependencies and only appears in the incoming dependencies of three classes (JavaParserFacade, Node, and LexicalPreservingPrinter), which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, but DataKey only has incoming dependencies and no outgoing ones."
