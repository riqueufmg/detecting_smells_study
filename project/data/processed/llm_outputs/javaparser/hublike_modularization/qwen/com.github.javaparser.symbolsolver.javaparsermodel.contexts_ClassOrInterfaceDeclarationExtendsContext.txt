    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeSolver, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, and SymbolReference. While these dependencies themselves have further dependencies, the ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationExtendsContext class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of direct dependencies."
