    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.DefaultPrettyPrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'DefaultPrettyPrinter' has outgoing dependencies to 4 different classes ('PrinterConfiguration', 'VoidVisitor', 'Printer', 'Node') and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class ('MetaModelGenerator'). The dependency on 'VoidVisitor' includes a large number of specific AST node types (over 100), indicating a broad outgoing dependency. Additionally, 'DefaultPrettyPrinter' is depended upon by 'MetaModelGenerator', showing incoming dependency. This pattern of multiple outgoing dependencies, including one very broad dependency, along with incoming dependencies, indicates hub-like modularization."
