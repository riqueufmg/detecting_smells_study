    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'BlockStmtContext' has outgoing dependencies to 10 different classes. It also has incoming dependencies from 0 classes. The total number of dependencies (incoming + outgoing) is 10, which indicates a high number of interactions with other abstractions, suggesting hub-like modularization."
