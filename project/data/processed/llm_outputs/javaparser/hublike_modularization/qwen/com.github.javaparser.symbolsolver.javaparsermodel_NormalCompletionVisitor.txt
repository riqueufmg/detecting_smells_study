    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'NormalCompletionVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 20 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
