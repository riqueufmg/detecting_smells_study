    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and incoming dependencies from 28 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
