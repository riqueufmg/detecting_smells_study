    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.GenericListVisitorAdapterGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 different classes, each of which also has multiple outgoing dependencies. The analyzed class depends on BlockStmt, MethodDeclaration, SourceRoot, CompilationUnit, and BaseNodeMetaModel. These dependencies indicate a high number of interactions with other abstractions, both directly and indirectly through their own dependencies, suggesting hub-like modularization."
