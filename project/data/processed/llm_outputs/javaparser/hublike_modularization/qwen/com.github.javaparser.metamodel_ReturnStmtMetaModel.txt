    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ReturnStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (ReturnStmt and JavaParserMetaModel). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
