    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeInference",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TypeInference' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both within its package and across other packages. This pattern of having many outgoing dependencies, combined with incoming dependencies, suggests hub-like behavior where 'TypeInference' acts as a central coordinator or hub in the system's architecture."
