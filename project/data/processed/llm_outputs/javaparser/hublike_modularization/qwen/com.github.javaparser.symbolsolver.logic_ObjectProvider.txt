    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic.ObjectProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to ResolvedReferenceType and no incoming dependencies. While the outgoing dependency ResolvedReferenceType has multiple dependencies itself (10 dependencies), the ObjectProvider class in isolation only maintains a single dependency relationship, which does not constitute hub-like modularization."
