    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'InferenceVariableType' has outgoing dependencies to 5 different classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class ('InferenceContext'), which indicates it interacts with multiple abstractions. Additionally, the dependencies it maintains are with core type resolution classes, suggesting central involvement in type inference logic, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
