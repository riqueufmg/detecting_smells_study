    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc.JavadocBlockTag.Type",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from JavadocBlockTag class within the same package. The incoming dependency shows JavadocBlockTag depends on JavadocBlockTag.Type, which is a normal parent-child relationship, not indicating hub-like modularization with many dependencies."
