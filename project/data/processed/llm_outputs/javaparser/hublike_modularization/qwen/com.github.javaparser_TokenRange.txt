    "justification": "The class TokenRange has outgoing dependencies to JavaToken and incoming dependencies from a large number of classes (48 unique classes) across multiple packages including ast.type, ast, ast.body, ast.nodeTypes, ast.stmt, ast.modules, ast.expr, ast.validator, ast.comments, and serialization. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
