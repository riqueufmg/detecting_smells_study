{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavassistEnumDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes/interfaces, including AccessSpecifier, JavassistFactory, ResolvedType, JavassistUtils, TypeSolver, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter, SymbolReference, Context, ResolvedFieldDeclaration, and JavassistClassDeclaration. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies listed, but the extensive outgoing connections alone satisfy the criteria for this smell."
