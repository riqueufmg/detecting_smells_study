    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AbstractTypeDeclaration' has incoming dependencies from 6 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
