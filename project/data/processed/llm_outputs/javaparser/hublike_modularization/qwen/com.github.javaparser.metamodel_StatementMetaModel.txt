    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'StatementMetaModel' has incoming dependencies from a large number of abstractions (26 from 'Statement' and 177 from 'JavaParserMetaModel'), indicating it acts as a hub with many connections. It also has no outgoing dependencies, which is typical for a hub-like abstraction that is referenced by many others but does not reference many itself."
