    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ModuleRequiresDirectiveMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (from ModuleRequiresDirective and JavaParserMetaModel). While JavaParserMetaModel shows a large number of dependencies, this reflects its role as a central registry and does not indicate hub-like modularization for ModuleRequiresDirectiveMetaModel itself. The class does not exhibit excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would qualify as hub-like modularization."
