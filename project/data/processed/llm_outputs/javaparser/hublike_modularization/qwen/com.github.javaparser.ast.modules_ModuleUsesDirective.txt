    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleUsesDirective",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ModuleUsesDirective has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (8) and incoming dependencies (20). The outgoing dependencies are focused on core AST node types and meta-model classes, indicating a cohesive responsibility. The incoming dependencies come primarily from visitor classes and other module-related directives, which is expected for a class in the AST hierarchy. This dependency profile does not indicate hub-like behavior, as the class is neither depended upon by a large number of other classes nor does it depend on a large number of other classes in a way that would suggest it is a central hub."
