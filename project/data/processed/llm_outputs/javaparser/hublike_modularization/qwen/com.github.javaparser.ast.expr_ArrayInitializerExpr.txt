    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ArrayInitializerExpr has a relatively low number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (approximately 20 from distinct sources). While it interacts with core classes like Node, NodeList, and various visitor types, the dependency count does not indicate an excessive or hub-like level of coupling. Hub-like modularization typically involves a class with a very high number of incoming and outgoing connections, often in the hundreds or more, which is not observed here."
