    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedWildcard' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions: 'ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration', 'ResolvedType', 'Context', and 'ResolvedWildcard.BoundType'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 13 other abstractions, including 'ReflectionFactory', 'MethodCallExprContext', 'LeastUpperBoundLogic', 'TypeHelper', 'JavassistUtils', 'WildcardType', 'LazyType', 'ResolvedType', 'ResolvedReferenceType', 'ResolvedTypeParameterValueProvider', 'InferenceContext', 'InferenceVariableType', and 'MethodResolutionLogic'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ResolvedWildcard' acts as a hub, connecting to many other parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
