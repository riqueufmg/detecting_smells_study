    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ForStmtMetaModel' has only one outgoing dependency to 'PropertyMetaModel' and two incoming dependencies from 'ForStmt' and 'JavaParserMetaModel'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies to/from many other abstractions."
