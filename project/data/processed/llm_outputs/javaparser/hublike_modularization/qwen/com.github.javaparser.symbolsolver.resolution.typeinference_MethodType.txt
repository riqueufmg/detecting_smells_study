    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.MethodType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodType' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('ResolvedType' and 'MethodUsage'), which in turn have dependencies to multiple other classes (7 and 5 respectively). Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes ('TypeHelper' and 'ExpressionCompatibleWithType'), which also depend on numerous other classes (13 and 16 respectively). This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with several abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
