    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class AssignExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (11) and incoming dependencies (46), indicating it interacts with numerous other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This extensive web of dependencies suggests a hub-like role in the system, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
