    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CallableDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'Type', 'Node', 'NodeList', 'Parameter', and 'ArrayType', which are central to the AST structure. Additionally, it depends on meta-model classes like 'CallableDeclarationMetaModel' and 'JavaParserMetaModel', which are likely to be widely used across the system. The incoming dependencies come from important structural classes such as 'TypeDeclaration', 'BodyDeclaration', and generator classes, indicating that 'CallableDeclaration' is a central abstraction that many other parts of the system rely on. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies suggests that 'CallableDeclaration' acts as a hub in the modularization structure."
