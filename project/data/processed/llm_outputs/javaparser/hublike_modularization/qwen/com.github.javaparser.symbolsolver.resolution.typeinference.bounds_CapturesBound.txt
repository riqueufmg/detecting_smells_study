    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'CapturesBound' has only one outgoing dependency to 'InferenceVariableSubstitution' and appears as a dependency in the incoming dependencies of 'BoundSet'. The number of direct dependencies is limited, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
