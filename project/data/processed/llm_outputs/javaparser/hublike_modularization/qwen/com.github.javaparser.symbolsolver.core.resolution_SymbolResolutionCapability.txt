    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.core.resolution.SymbolResolutionCapability",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (TypeSolver and SymbolReference) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, indicating limited connectivity rather than hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
