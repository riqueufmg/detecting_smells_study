    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassOrInterfaceType' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (15) and incoming dependencies (64), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive connectivity, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization where a single class becomes a central point of interaction within the system."
