    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.JavadocComment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavadocComment has a high number of outgoing dependencies (8) and incoming dependencies (34). It is referenced by numerous visitor classes (VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, etc.) and other core classes in the AST hierarchy. Additionally, it connects to meta-model and utility classes (JavaParserMetaModel, Javadoc, StaticJavaParser), indicating central involvement in both parsing and representation logic. This extensive interaction with various parts of the system indicates Hub-like Modularization."
