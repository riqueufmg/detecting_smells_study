{
    "class": "issue1945.interfaces.HairType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (MainIssue1945, HairyAnimal, HairTypeRenderer) and no outgoing dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
