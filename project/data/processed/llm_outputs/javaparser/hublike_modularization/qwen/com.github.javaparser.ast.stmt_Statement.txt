    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Statement class has outgoing dependencies to 26 other classes and incoming dependencies from 34 classes, indicating it is highly connected. This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies suggests that Statement acts as a hub abstraction, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
