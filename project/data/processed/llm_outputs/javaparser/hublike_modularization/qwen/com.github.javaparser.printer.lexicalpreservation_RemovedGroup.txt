    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.RemovedGroup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'RemovedGroup' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to classes such as 'Node', 'Removed', 'CsmToken', 'LexicalDifferenceCalculator', 'JavaToken', and 'TokenTypes'. The incoming dependencies come only from the 'Difference' class. This level of dependency is not indicative of hub-like modularization, which would require a significantly larger number of dependencies suggesting centralization of functionality or control."
