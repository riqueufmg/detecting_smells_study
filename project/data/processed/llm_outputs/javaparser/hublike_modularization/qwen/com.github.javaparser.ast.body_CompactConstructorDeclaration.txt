    "justification": "The class CompactConstructorDeclaration has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (23). It interacts with numerous visitor classes, adapter classes, and other core classes in the AST hierarchy. The large number of dependencies indicates that it is a central node in the architecture, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
