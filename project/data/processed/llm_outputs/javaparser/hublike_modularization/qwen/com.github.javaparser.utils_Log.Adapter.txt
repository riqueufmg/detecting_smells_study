    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.Log.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class Log. The low number of dependencies (only 1 total) does not indicate hub-like modularization, which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
