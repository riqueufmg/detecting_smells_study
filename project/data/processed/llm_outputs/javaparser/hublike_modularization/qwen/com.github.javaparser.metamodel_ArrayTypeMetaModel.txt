    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ArrayTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (ArrayType and JavaParserMetaModel). The total number of direct dependencies is three, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization requires a large number of dependencies, typically much higher than what is observed here."
