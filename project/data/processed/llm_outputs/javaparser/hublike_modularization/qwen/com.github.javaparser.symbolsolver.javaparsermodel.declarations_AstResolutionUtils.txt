    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AstResolutionUtils' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes and incoming dependencies from 8 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting multiple abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
