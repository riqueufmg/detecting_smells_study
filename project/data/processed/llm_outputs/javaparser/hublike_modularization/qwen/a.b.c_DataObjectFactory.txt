{
    "class": "a.b.c.DataObjectFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 incoming dependency from ExampleClass and 0 outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependency involves 2 classes (DataObject and DataObjectFactory) but this represents a minimal dependency pattern rather than hub-like modularization. There is no evidence of dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
