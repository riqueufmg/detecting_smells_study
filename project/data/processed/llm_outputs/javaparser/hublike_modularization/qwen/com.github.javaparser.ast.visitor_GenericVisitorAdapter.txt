    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'GenericVisitorAdapter' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (76 classes) and incoming dependencies (1 class), indicating hub-like modularization. The large number of outgoing dependencies suggests that this class interacts with many other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
