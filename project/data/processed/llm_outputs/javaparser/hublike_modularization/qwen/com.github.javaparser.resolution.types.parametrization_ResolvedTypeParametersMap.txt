    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes. The total number of dependencies (8) is high, indicating hub-like modularization. Additionally, the class interacts with core types such as ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration and ResolvedType, which are likely to be widely used across the system, further supporting the presence of hub-like modularization."
