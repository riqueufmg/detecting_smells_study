    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.MainConstructorGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MainConstructorGenerator' has outgoing dependencies to 8 different classes: 'ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration', 'StaticJavaParser', 'BlockStmt', 'SourceRoot', 'CompilationUnit', 'SeparatedItemStringBuilder', 'ConstructorDeclaration', and 'BaseNodeMetaModel'. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies, but the outgoing dependency count alone is sufficient to qualify as a hub-like module given the context size of 1815."
