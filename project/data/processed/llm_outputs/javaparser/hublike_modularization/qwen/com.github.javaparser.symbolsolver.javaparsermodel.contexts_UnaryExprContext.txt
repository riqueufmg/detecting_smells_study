    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeSolver and UnaryExpr, each of which has multiple internal dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself. The class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
