    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmSingleReference",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CsmSingleReference has outgoing dependencies to 4 different classes (Node, ConcreteSyntaxModel, ObservableProperty, SourcePrinter) and incoming dependencies from 1 class (LexicalDifferenceCalculator). The outgoing dependencies from CsmSingleReference involve interactions with a wide range of other classes across different packages, indicating it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. Additionally, the incoming dependency from LexicalDifferenceCalculator shows that this class is also a central point of reference for other parts of the system, further supporting the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
