    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.Comment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Comment' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 21 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Comment' acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
