    "class": "demo.Main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'demo.Main' has outgoing dependencies to 4 distinct abstractions: 'com.github.javaparser.utils.ParserCollectionStrategy', 'com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot', 'com.github.javaparser.utils.ProjectRoot', and 'demo.Main.Callback'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 0 abstractions. The total number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is 4, which indicates a high level of coupling and qualifies as Hub-like Modularization based on the provided data."
