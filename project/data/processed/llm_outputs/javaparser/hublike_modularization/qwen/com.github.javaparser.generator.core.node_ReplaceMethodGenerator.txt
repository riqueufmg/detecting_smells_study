    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.ReplaceMethodGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReplaceMethodGenerator' has outgoing dependencies to 8 different classes. Additionally, some of these dependencies like 'StaticJavaParser' and 'CompilationUnit' have extensive dependency lists themselves (20+ dependencies), indicating that 'ReplaceMethodGenerator' connects to abstractions that are also highly connected. This creates a hub-like structure where the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions both directly and indirectly through its dependencies."
