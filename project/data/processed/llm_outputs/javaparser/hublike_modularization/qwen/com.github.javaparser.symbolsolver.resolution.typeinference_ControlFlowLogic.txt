    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ControlFlowLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ControlFlowLogic' has outgoing dependencies to 16 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the incoming dependency from 'ExpressionCompatibleWithType' shows that it is also a central point of reliance, further supporting the presence of this smell."
