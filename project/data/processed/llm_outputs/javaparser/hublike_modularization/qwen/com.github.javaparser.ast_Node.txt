    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.ast.Node' has a large number of outgoing dependencies (23) and incoming dependencies (167), indicating it interacts with a wide range of other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This extensive bidirectional interaction pattern is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization, where a single class becomes a central point of communication within the system."
