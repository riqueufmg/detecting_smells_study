    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'GenericVisitor' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (as seen in the 'dependencies' list of 'analyzed_package') and also appears as a dependency in numerous other classes across different packages (as shown in multiple entries in 'incoming_dependencies'). This pattern of having many outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
