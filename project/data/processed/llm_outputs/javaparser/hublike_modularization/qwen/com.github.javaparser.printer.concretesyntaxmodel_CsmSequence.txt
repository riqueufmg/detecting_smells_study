    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmSequence",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CsmSequence has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Node and SourcePrinter) and 1 incoming dependency (LexicalDifferenceCalculator). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization typically involves a large number of dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, which is not observed in this case."
