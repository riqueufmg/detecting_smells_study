    "justification": "The class 'MethodResolutionLogic' has outgoing dependencies to 18 other classes and incoming dependencies from 13 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MethodResolutionLogic' acts as a hub, connecting numerous abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
