    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CastExprMetaModel has only one outgoing dependency to PropertyMetaModel and two incoming dependencies from CastExpr and JavaParserMetaModel. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies to and/or from many other abstractions."
