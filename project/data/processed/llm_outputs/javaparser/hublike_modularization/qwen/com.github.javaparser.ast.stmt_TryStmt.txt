    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.TryStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TryStmt has a large number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (32). The outgoing dependencies include core meta-model and AST classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, TryStmtMetaModel, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, NodeList, TokenRange, BlockStmt, and ObservableProperty. The incoming dependencies consist of numerous visitor implementations, context classes, and other AST statement types, indicating that TryStmt is widely used and interacts with many other abstractions both in terms of usage and being used. This high degree of connectivity in both directions confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
