    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmTextBlock",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CsmTextBlock has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Node, ObservableProperty, and SourcePrinter, which are relatively few and focused. None of these dependencies show a pattern of excessive coupling or indicate that CsmTextBlock acts as a hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions. Therefore, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
