    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (AstObserver and Node) and no incoming dependencies. While the Node class itself has many dependencies, the PhantomNodeLogic class does not directly depend on those numerous classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
