    "justification": "The class ArrayCreationExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (37). It depends on various core classes such as VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, Node, Type, and others. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor classes, parser classes, and other expression classes, indicating it is a central element in the system with extensive interactions both in terms of usage and implementation reliance, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
