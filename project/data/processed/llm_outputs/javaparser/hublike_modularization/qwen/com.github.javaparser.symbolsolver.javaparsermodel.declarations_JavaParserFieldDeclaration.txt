    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserFieldDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavaParserFieldDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as JavaParserFacade, FieldDeclaration, VariableDeclarator, and ResolvedType, among others. The incoming dependencies come from JavaSymbolSolver and JavaParserSymbolDeclaration. This pattern of having both a large number of outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates that JavaParserFieldDeclaration acts as a hub, connecting various parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
