    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Parameter' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (14) and incoming dependencies (54), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive connectivity, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, suggests a hub-like role in the system, thus qualifying as Hub-like Modularization."
