    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DoStmtMetaModel has only one outgoing dependency to PropertyMetaModel and two incoming dependencies from DoStmt and JavaParserMetaModel. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and it does not exhibit hub-like modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
