{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot.ParallelParse",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot' and one incoming dependency from the same class. The dependencies listed under SourceRoot do not represent direct dependencies of ParallelParse, but rather dependencies of the SourceRoot class itself. Therefore, ParallelParse does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
