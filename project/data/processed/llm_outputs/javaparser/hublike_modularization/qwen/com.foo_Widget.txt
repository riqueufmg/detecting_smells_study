```json
{
    "class": "com.foo.Widget",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Widget' in package 'com.foo' has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct external classes. Each of these external classes also has a high number of dependencies themselves (ranging from 5 to over 30 dependencies). This indicates that 'Widget' is connected to multiple complex abstractions, creating a hub-like structure where it interacts with many other components, thus exhibiting the Hub-like Modularization smell."
