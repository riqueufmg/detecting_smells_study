    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 134 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
