    "justification": "The class NodeMetaModel has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including Node, CommonValidators, JavaParserMetaModel, and several printer classes (XmlPrinter, DotPrinter, YamlPrinter). Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to PropertyMetaModel which itself has further dependencies. The number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates a hub-like modularization smell."
