    "justification": "The class 'TypeInferenceCache' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes ('ResolvedType', 'TypeSolver', 'LambdaExpr'), each of which has multiple further dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 classes ('TypeInference', 'ExpressionCompatibleWithType'), each with numerous dependencies. This creates a hub-like structure where 'TypeInferenceCache' is central to many dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
