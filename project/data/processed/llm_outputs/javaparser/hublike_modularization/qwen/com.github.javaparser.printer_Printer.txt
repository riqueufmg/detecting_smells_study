    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
