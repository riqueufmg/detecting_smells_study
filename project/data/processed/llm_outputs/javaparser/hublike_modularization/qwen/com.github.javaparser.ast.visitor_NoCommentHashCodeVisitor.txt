    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'NoCommentHashCodeVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 123 different classes across various packages. This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a wide range of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies listed, but the extensive outgoing dependencies alone are sufficient to classify this as hub-like modularization."
