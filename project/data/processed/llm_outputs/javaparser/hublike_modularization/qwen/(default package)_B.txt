    "class": "(default package).B",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class B has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Preconditions and A) and 1 incoming dependency (ConstantA). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
