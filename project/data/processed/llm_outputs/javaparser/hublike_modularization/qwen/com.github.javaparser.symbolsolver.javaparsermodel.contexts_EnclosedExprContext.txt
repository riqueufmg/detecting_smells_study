    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.EnclosedExprContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to TypeSolver and EnclosedExpr, each of which has multiple internal dependencies, but the EnclosedExprContext itself does not directly depend on those internal classes. The low number of direct dependencies (2 outgoing, 0 incoming) does not indicate hub-like modularization."
