    "justification": "The class 'SymbolResolver' has outgoing dependencies to 5 different classes and incoming dependencies from 4 different classes. Additionally, the dependent classes such as 'Node', 'Expression', and 'Type' have extensive dependency lists, indicating that 'SymbolResolver' acts as a central hub connecting various parts of the system. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
