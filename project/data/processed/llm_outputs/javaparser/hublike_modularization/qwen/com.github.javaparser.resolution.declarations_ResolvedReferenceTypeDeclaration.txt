    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration' has a high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It is depended upon by 54 other classes and it depends on 3 other classes. The incoming dependencies include numerous classes from packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel', and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.types', indicating it is a central abstraction that many other components rely on. The outgoing dependencies, while fewer, connect to core types like 'ResolvedType' and 'ResolvedFieldDeclaration', showing it also relies on a broad set of other abstractions. This pattern of having many dependencies both incoming and outgoing confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
