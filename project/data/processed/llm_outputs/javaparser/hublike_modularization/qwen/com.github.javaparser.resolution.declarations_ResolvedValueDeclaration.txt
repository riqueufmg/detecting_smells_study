    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedValueDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 'ResolvedType' which in turn has dependencies to 9 other classes. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 6 different classes, including 'JavaSymbolSolver' which itself depends on 26 other classes. This indicates that 'ResolvedValueDeclaration' acts as a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
