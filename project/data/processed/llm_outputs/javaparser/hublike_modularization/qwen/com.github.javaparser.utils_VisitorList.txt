    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorList' exhibits Hub-like Modularization because it has a high number of outgoing dependencies (64) to various classes in the 'com.github.javaparser.ast' package hierarchy, indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from at least one other class ('VisitorList.EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade'), showing bidirectional coupling. This central role in managing dependencies across numerous abstractions confirms the presence of the smell."
