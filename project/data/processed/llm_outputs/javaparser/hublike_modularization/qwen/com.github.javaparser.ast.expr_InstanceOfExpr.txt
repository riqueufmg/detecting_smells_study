    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class InstanceOfExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (44). It depends on various core classes such as VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, Node, Expression, ReferenceType, and others. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor implementations and utility classes like DefaultVisitorAdapter, TypeExtractor, PatternVariableVisitor, etc. This extensive bidirectional dependency network indicates that InstanceOfExpr acts as a hub within the system, connecting to and being connected by many other abstractions."
