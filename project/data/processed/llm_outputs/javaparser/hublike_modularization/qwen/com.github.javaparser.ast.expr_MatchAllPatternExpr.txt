    "justification": "The class has a relatively low number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It depends on 8 other classes and is depended upon by 20 classes. This is not indicative of a hub-like modularization smell, as it does not show an excessive amount of dependencies that would suggest it is a central hub in the system."
