    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.WildcardTypeMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'PropertyMetaModel' and a limited number of incoming dependencies from two classes ('WildcardType' and 'JavaParserMetaModel'). The amount of dependencies is not excessive enough to qualify as hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies to or from many other abstractions."
