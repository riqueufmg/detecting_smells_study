    "class": "com.github.javaparser.UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider.PositionMapping",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider. The incoming dependencies show a total of 5 dependencies from the enclosing class, but this represents a normal parent-child relationship rather than hub-like modularization. The class does not exhibit dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
