    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 other class and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies (7) indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the class is depended upon by classes across different packages, further supporting the presence of this smell."
