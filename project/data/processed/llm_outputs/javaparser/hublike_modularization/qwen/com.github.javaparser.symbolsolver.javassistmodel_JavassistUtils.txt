    "justification": "The class 'JavassistUtils' has outgoing dependencies to 17 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'JavassistUtils' acts as a hub, connecting numerous abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
