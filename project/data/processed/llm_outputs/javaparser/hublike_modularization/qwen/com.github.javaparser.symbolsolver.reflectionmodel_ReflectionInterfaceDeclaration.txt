    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 16 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class ('SymbolSolver'). The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, both within its own package and across different packages. This pattern of having many outgoing dependencies classifies it as hub-like modularization."
