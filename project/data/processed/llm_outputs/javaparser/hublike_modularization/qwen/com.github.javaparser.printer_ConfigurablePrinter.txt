{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.ConfigurablePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes (PrinterConfiguration, Printer) and incoming dependencies from 1 class (Node) which itself has dependencies with 21 other abstractions. The high number of incoming dependencies from Node indicates that ConfigurablePrinter is involved in a hub-like dependency structure."
