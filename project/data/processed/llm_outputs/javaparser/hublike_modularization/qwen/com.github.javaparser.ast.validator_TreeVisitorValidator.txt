    "justification": "The class 'TreeVisitorValidator' has only 3 outgoing dependencies ('ProblemReporter', 'Validator', and 'Node') and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of it being a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
