    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.VisitorGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'VisitorGenerator' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and 0 incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies include 'ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration', 'MethodDeclaration', 'SourceRoot', 'CompilationUnit', 'JavaParserMetaModel', and 'BaseNodeMetaModel'. Among these, 'JavaParserMetaModel' itself has a very large number of dependencies (84), indicating it is a hub. Additionally, 'VisitorGenerator' interacts with core and widely-used classes such as 'CompilationUnit' and 'SourceRoot', which are likely to be central in the architecture. Although there are no incoming dependencies listed, the extensive outgoing dependencies to central and highly-connected classes justify the detection of Hub-like Modularization."
