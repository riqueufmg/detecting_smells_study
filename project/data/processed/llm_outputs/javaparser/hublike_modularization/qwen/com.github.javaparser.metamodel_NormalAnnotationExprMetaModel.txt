    "justification": "The class 'NormalAnnotationExprMetaModel' has a high number of incoming dependencies, particularly from 'JavaParserMetaModel' which depends on a large number of meta-model classes including this one. It also has outgoing dependencies to 'PropertyMetaModel', which in turn has multiple dependencies. This pattern of having many incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization."
