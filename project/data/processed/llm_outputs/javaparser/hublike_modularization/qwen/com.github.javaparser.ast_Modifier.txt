    "justification": "The class 'Modifier' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (64), indicating it is connected to a large number of other abstractions. This extensive connectivity, both in terms of classes depending on it and it depending on others, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
