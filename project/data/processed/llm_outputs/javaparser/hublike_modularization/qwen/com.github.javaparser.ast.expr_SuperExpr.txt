    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class SuperExpr has a relatively low number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (20), and these dependencies are typical for a node in an AST representing a specific expression type. While it interacts with core AST classes like Node, Expression, and various visitors, the number and nature of its dependencies do not indicate hub-like modularization where a single class would have an excessive number of connections to many other parts of the system in a centralizing manner. The dependencies are contextually appropriate for its role in the AST hierarchy."
