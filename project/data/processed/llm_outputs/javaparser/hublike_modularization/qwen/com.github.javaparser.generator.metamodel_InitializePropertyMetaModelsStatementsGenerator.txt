    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.InitializePropertyMetaModelsStatementsGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as StaticJavaParser, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, NodeList, and MetaModelGenerator, which are central to the JavaParser AST and generation functionality. The incoming dependency is from NodeMetaModelGenerator, which is in the same package and is likely a key component in the metamodel generation process. This pattern of having multiple outgoing dependencies to central classes and being depended upon by another significant class indicates hub-like modularization."
