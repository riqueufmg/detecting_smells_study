    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Reshuffled' has a limited number of dependencies, both incoming and outgoing. It depends on only three classes: 'DifferenceElement', 'CsmMix', and 'CsmElement'. Additionally, it is depended upon by one class, 'ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor', which itself has multiple dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessive relative to the context size of 783, and there is no indication that 'Reshuffled' acts as a central hub connecting a large portion of the system. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
