    "justification": "The class LambdaExprContext has outgoing dependencies to 22 other classes, which is a high number indicating hub-like behavior. It also shows incoming dependencies, although they are not detailed in the provided data. The large number of outgoing dependencies to various core and utility classes across different packages indicates that this class acts as a central hub interacting with many other abstractions in the system."
