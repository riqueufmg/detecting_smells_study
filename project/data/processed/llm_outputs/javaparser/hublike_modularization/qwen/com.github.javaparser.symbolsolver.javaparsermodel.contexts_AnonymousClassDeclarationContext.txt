    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AnonymousClassDeclarationContext' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Although there are no incoming dependencies, the extensive outgoing connections suggest it acts as a hub in the system architecture."
