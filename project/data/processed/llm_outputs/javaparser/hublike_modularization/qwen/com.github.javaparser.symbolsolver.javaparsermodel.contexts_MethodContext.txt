    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.MethodContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MethodContext has only 3 outgoing dependencies (Node, TypeSolver, MethodDeclaration) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
