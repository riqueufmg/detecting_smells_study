    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BinaryExpr has only 2 incoming dependencies from 2 different classes (AClass from foo.bar and AClass from foo.bar.differentpackage), which is not a large number of dependencies indicating hub-like modularization. There are no outgoing dependencies. The dependency count is low and does not suggest hub-like behavior."
