    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserTypeVariableDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 12 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JavaParserFacade'), which indicates it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This high number of dependencies, both incoming and outgoing, suggests hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
