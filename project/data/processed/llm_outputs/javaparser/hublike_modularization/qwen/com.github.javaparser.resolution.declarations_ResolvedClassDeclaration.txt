{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedClassDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies from other classes. The incoming dependencies show that AbstractClassDeclaration and ResolvedTypeDeclaration reference this class, but this does not constitute a hub-like pattern as the number of dependencies is relatively low and the class does not show excessive connectivity with many other abstractions."
