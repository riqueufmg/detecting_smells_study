    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.JavaSymbolSolver.ArrayLengthValueDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'ResolvedPrimitiveType' and one incoming dependency from 'JavaSymbolSolver'. The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive coupling with a large number of abstractions, which would be required to classify it as Hub-like Modularization."
