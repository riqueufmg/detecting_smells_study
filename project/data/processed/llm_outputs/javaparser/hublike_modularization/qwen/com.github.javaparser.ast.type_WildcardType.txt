    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class WildcardType has a high number of outgoing dependencies (13) and incoming dependencies (32). It interacts with numerous visitor classes, meta-model classes, and core AST classes, indicating it is central to many operations and is referenced by a large number of other abstractions. This extensive dependency pattern, both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
