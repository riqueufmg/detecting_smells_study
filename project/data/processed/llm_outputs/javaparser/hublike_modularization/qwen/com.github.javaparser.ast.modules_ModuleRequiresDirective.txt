    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ModuleRequiresDirective' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (20+ classes across multiple packages), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of usage and being used. This extensive connectivity suggests hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
