    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.Generator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Generator' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes: 'ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration', 'NodeList', 'MethodDeclaration', 'Expression', 'SourceRoot', and 'CallableDeclaration'. Additionally, the dependencies of these classes reveal a wide range of further dependencies (e.g., 'Expression' has 50+ dependencies), indicating that 'Generator' indirectly interacts with a large number of abstractions. This high number of both direct and indirect dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
