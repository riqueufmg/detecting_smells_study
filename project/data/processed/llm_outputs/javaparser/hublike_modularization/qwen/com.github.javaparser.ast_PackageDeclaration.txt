    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class PackageDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 27 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
