{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.EnumDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies, with 'com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumDeclaration' and 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel' each depending on a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel', which also has multiple dependencies. This pattern of both high incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
