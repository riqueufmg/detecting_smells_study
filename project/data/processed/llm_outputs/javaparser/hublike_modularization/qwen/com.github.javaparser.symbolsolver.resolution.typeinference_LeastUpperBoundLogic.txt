    "justification": "The class 'LeastUpperBoundLogic' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions: TypeHelper, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceType, and LeastUpperBoundLogic.TypeSubstitution. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 3 other abstractions: TypeExtractor, MethodCallExprContext, and TypeHelper. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
