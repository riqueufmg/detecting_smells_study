    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ReturnStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ReturnStmt has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 34 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include core meta-model and AST classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, Range, GenericVisitor, ReturnStmtMetaModel, VoidVisitor, TokenRange, Expression, and ObservableProperty. The incoming dependencies come from various visitors, contexts, statements, and parser components, indicating that ReturnStmt is both widely used and depends on many other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
