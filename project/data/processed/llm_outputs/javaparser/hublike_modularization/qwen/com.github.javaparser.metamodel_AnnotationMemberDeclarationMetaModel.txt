    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AnnotationMemberDeclarationMetaModel' has incoming dependencies from a large number of other abstractions (e.g., 64 dependencies from 'JavaParserMetaModel' and 14 from 'AnnotationMemberDeclaration'), and it also has outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions including 'PropertyMetaModel'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
