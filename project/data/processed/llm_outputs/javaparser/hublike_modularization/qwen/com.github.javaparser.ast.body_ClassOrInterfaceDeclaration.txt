    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration class has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (58), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. Its outgoing dependencies include core metamodel and AST classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, Range, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationMetaModel, NodeList, TokenRange, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavadocComment, SimpleName, and ObservableProperty. Additionally, it has a substantial number of incoming dependencies from various packages, particularly from symbolsolver and visitor-related classes, showing that many other abstractions depend on it. This extensive bidirectional interaction confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
