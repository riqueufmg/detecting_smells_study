    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes, but no incoming dependencies. While it depends on multiple classes, the lack of incoming dependencies indicates it is not a central hub in the architecture. Hub-like Modularization requires both high outgoing and incoming dependencies to be considered present."
