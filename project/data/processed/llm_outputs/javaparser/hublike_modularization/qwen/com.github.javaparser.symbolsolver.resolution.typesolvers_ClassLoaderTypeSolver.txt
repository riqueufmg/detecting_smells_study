    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers.ClassLoaderTypeSolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a moderate number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to core resolution and reflection classes which is expected for a type solver. The incoming dependencies come from a single builder class which is a typical usage pattern. The number and nature of dependencies do not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have excessive or disproportionate dependency connections."
