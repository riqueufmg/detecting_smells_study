    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to ResolvedType and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency ResolvedType has multiple dependencies but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class itself, as it only directly depends on one abstraction."
