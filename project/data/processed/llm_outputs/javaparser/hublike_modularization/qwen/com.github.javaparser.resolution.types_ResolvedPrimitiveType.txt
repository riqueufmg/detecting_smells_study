    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedPrimitiveType' has outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions ('ResolvedType', 'TypeUtils') and incoming dependencies from 16 other abstractions. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many other classes depend on 'ResolvedPrimitiveType', which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, 'ResolvedPrimitiveType' appears in the dependencies list of many other classes, showing it is widely used across the system, further supporting the presence of this smell."
