    "justification": "The class TypedValidator has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. A hub-like module would typically have a significantly larger number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, acting as a central point of communication between many other modules. The provided data does not show such a pattern for this class."
