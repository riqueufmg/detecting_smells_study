{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Range",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Range' has incoming dependencies from 58 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 other class ('Position'). The high number of incoming dependencies (58) indicates that many other abstractions depend on 'Range', which is a strong indicator of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, 'Range' is used across various packages including 'com.github.javaparser.ast', 'com.github.javaparser.ast.type', 'com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt', 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr', and others, further supporting its role as a hub in the system architecture."
