    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.BinaryExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class BinaryExpr has a large number of outgoing dependencies (11) and incoming dependencies (43). It depends on core classes like VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, Node, Expression, and JavaParserMetaModel, which are central to the AST structure. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor classes, facade classes, and other AST expression types, indicating it is a central hub in the architecture. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
