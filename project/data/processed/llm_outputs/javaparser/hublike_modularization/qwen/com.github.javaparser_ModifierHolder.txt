    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ModifierHolder' has incoming dependencies from a large number of other abstractions (49 dependencies listed from 'GeneratedJavaParser') and outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions including 'NodeList' and 'JavaToken', which in turn have their own extensive dependencies. This creates a hub-like structure where 'ModifierHolder' acts as a central point connecting numerous other components."
