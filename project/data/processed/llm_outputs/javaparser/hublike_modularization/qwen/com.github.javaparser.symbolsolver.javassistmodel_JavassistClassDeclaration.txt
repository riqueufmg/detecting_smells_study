    "justification": "The class JavassistClassDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 12 different classes and incoming dependencies from 3 different classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
