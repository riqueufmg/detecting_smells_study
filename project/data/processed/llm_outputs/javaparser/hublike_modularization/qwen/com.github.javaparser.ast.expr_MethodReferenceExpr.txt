    "justification": "The class MethodReferenceExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (46), indicating it interacts with numerous other abstractions both in terms of usage and being used. This extensive web of dependencies suggests a central role in the system, characteristic of hub-like modularization where one component becomes a focal point for many others."
