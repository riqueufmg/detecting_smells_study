    "justification": "The class 'ArrayCreationLevel' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (21). It depends on multiple core classes such as 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'Node', 'GenericVisitor', 'VoidVisitor', 'NodeList', 'Expression', and 'ObservableProperty'. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor classes and other components across the system, indicating it acts as a hub in the modular structure."
