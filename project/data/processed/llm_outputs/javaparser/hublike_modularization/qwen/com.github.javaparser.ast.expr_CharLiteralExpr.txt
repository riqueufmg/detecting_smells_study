    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CharLiteralExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (8) and incoming dependencies (20). While it interacts with various visitor and utility classes, the number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization. The dependencies are typical for a node in an AST representing a specific literal expression type, interacting with visitors, utilities, and meta-model classes without acting as a central hub."
