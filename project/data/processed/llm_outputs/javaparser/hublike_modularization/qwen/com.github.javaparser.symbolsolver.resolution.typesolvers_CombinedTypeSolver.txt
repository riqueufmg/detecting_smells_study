    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CombinedTypeSolver has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple components in the system."
