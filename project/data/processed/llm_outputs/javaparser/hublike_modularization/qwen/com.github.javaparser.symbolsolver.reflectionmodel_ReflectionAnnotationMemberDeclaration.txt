    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionAnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionAnnotationMemberDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes: 'NodeList', 'ResolvedType', 'Expression', 'TypeSolver', 'SymbolReference', and 'ResolvedPrimitiveType'. Additionally, some of these dependencies have further outgoing dependencies, increasing the overall number of indirect dependencies. For example, 'ResolvedType' depends on 9 other classes, and 'Expression' depends on 45 other classes. This results in a large number of total dependencies (both direct and indirect), indicating hub-like modularization."
