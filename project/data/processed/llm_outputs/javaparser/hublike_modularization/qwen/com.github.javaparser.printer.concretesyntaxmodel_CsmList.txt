    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CsmList has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as NodeList, ConcreteSyntaxModel, Node, SourcePrinter, ObservableProperty, PrintingHelper, and CsmElement. The incoming dependencies come from LexicalDifferenceCalculator, which itself depends on multiple classes including CsmList. This pattern of having numerous outgoing and incoming dependencies indicates that CsmList acts as a hub connecting various parts of the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
