    "class": "com.github.javaparser.RangedList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RangedList' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes: 'NodeList', 'JavaToken', and 'TokenRange'. Meanwhile, it has incoming dependencies from 1 class ('GeneratedJavaParser'), which itself has dependencies to a very large number of other classes (50+). Although the direct incoming dependency count is low, the indirect incoming dependencies via 'GeneratedJavaParser' indicate that 'RangedList' is involved in a hub-like structure where it connects to many abstractions through its relationships. Additionally, its outgoing dependencies connect to classes that also have extensive relationships, increasing its overall connectivity within the system."
