    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserTypeSolver' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with a large number of abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
