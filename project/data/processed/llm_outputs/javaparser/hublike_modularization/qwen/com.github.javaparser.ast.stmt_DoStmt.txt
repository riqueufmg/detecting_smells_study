    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'DoStmt' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (44). It interacts with numerous visitor classes, context classes, and other AST node types, indicating it is a central node in the architecture. This extensive dependency pattern, both in terms of fan-in and fan-out, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
