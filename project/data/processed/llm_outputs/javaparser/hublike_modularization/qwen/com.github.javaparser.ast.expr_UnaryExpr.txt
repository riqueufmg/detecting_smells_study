    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class UnaryExpr has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It is referenced by many classes in the visitor pattern implementations (e.g., VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, HashCodeVisitor, etc.) and other components like TypeExtractor, DefaultVisitorAdapter, and printer classes. Additionally, it depends on multiple core classes such as Node, Range, TokenRange, and various meta-model classes. The extensive use of UnaryExpr across different parts of the system indicates hub-like modularization."
