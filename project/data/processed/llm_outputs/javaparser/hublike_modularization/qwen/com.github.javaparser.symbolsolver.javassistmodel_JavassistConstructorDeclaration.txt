    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization, especially considering the class operates in an environment where interaction with multiple type resolution and AST classes is expected."
