    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.NameExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'NameExprMetaModel' has only one outgoing dependency ('PropertyMetaModel') and two incoming dependencies ('NameExpr' and 'JavaParserMetaModel'). This is not indicative of hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction."
