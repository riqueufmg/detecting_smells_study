    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParseStart",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'ParseStart' has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ParseException and GeneratedJavaParser) and 3 incoming dependencies from other classes (CompilationUnit, CompilationUnit.Storage, and JavaParser). While one of its outgoing dependencies, GeneratedJavaParser, shows a large number of its own dependencies, the 'ParseStart' class itself does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies in either direction. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly, which is not the case here based on the provided data."
