    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MarkerAnnotationExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MarkerAnnotationExpr' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (20). It interacts with numerous visitor classes, node types, and parser components, indicating it is a central point of interaction within the system. This extensive dependency pattern, both in terms of fan-in and fan-out, qualifies as hub-like modularization where the class acts as a hub connecting to many other abstractions."
