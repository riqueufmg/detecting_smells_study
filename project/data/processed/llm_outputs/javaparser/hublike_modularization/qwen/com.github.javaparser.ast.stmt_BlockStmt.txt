    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "BlockStmt has a high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It appears in the dependencies of many visitor classes (GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, and their variants), context classes, and statement-related classes. Additionally, it is involved in various control flow and expression-related dependencies, indicating it is central to many operations within the AST structure. The large number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) confirms the Hub-like Modularization smell."
