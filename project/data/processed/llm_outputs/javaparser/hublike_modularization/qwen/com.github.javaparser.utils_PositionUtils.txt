    "justification": "The class PositionUtils has only 9 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as Hub-like Modularization. There is no evidence of the class being a central hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections beyond what is typical for a utility class."
