    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'PrimitiveType' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (13) and incoming dependencies (43). It interacts with numerous classes across different packages, such as 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'GenericVisitor', 'VoidVisitor', 'ResolvedType', and many visitor and meta-model classes. This extensive interaction pattern, both in terms of using other classes and being used by a wide range of other classes, indicates hub-like modularization where 'PrimitiveType' acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
