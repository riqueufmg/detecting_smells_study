    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'LiteralStringValueExpr' has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes and incoming dependencies from 3 classes. The outgoing dependency to 'JavaParserMetaModel' involves dependencies on 147 other classes, indicating a high number of outgoing relationships. Additionally, the incoming dependencies come from multiple distinct classes including validators and expression-related classes, showing a significant number of incoming relationships. This pattern of having many incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies as Hub-like Modularization."
