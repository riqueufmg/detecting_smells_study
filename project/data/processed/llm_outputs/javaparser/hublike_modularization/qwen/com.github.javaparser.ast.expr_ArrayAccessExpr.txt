    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayAccessExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ArrayAccessExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (35), indicating it interacts with many other abstractions. Its outgoing dependencies include core visitor classes like VoidVisitor and GenericVisitor, which themselves have extensive dependency lists, suggesting ArrayAccessExpr is a central node in the architecture. Additionally, it appears in the dependencies of numerous visitor implementations and utility classes, reinforcing its role as a hub with significant incoming and outgoing connections."
