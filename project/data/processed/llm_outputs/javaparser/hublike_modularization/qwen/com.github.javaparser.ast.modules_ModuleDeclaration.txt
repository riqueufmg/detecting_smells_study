    "justification": "The class 'ModuleDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (11) and incoming dependencies (24). It interacts with numerous visitor classes, meta-model classes, and core AST classes, indicating it is a central hub in the architecture. This extensive dependency network, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, satisfies the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
