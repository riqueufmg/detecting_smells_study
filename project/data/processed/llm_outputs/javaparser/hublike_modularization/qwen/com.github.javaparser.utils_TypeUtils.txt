{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.TypeUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from different classes and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies are from ReflectionMethodDeclaration (10 dependencies) and ResolvedPrimitiveType (2 dependencies). While the first incoming dependency has multiple references, the total number of distinct dependent classes is low (2), which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
