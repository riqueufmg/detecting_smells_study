{
    "class": "com.example.Beta.CustomInterface",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from com.example.Beta, which itself only depends on 2 classes (com.example.Alpha and com.example.Beta.CustomInterface). This does not indicate hub-like modularization as the dependency count is low and the class is not central to a large number of other abstractions."
