    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class VoidVisitorWithDefaults has outgoing dependencies to 123 different classes, which is significantly high and indicates it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive number of dependencies, both in terms of unique classes and the breadth of packages involved (e.g., com.github.javaparser.ast.expr, com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt, com.github.javaparser.ast.type, etc.), suggests hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central point connecting to many other components."
