    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 0 abstractions. The outgoing dependencies include complex and numerous relationships with classes such as JavaParserFacade (which itself has 50+ dependencies), ResolvedType, Expression, and others. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
