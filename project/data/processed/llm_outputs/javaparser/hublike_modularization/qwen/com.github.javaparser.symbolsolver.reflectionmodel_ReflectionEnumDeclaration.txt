    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionEnumDeclaration' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
