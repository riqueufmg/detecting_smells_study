    "justification": "The class NodeWithTypeArguments has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (Type and NodeList), each of which has numerous dependencies themselves. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 3 classes (Expression, PrettyPrintVisitor, and DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor), each with extensive dependency lists. The large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
