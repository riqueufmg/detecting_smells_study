    "justification": "The class 'ReferenceType' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (8) and incoming dependencies (21), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive connectivity, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
