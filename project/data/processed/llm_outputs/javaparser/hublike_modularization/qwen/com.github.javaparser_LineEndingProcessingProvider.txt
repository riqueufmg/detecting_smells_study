{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.LineEndingProcessingProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Provider and LineSeparator) and 2 incoming dependencies (ParserConfiguration and ParserConfiguration.LineEndingProcessor). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
