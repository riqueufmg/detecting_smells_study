    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'PropertyMetaModel' has a high number of incoming dependencies (84) from various meta-model classes within the same package and several outgoing dependencies (3), including 'BaseNodeMetaModel' which itself has numerous dependencies. This pattern of many incoming and outgoing connections indicates hub-like modularization, where 'PropertyMetaModel' acts as a central point connecting numerous other abstractions."
