    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.ContextHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ContextHelper' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('Context' and 'ResolvedTypeDeclaration'), which in turn have multiple further dependencies. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 4 different classes ('ReflectionClassDeclaration', 'ReflectionRecordDeclaration', 'MethodCallExprContext', 'JavassistUtils'), each with a substantial list of dependencies. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where 'ContextHelper' acts as a central hub connecting various parts of the system."
