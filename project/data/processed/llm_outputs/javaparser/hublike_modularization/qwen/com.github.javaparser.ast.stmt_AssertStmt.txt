    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class AssertStmt has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (24). It depends on multiple core classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, Expression, and ObservableProperty. Additionally, it is widely used by various visitor implementations and other components like DefaultVisitorAdapter, ControlFlowLogic, Statement, and multiple classes in the visitor and printer packages. This extensive bidirectional dependency network indicates Hub-like Modularization."
