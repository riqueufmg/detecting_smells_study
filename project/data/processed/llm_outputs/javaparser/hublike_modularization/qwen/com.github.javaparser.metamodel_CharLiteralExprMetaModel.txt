{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CharLiteralExprMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies but is involved in incoming dependencies from two other classes, one of which (JavaParserMetaModel) has a very large number of dependencies. This indicates that the class acts as a hub in the modularization structure due to its central role in being referenced by highly connected classes."
