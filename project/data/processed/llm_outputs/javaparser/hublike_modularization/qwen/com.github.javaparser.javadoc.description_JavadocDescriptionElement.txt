{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc.description.JavadocDescriptionElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from JavadocInlineTag and JavadocDescription classes, and no outgoing dependencies. This represents a low number of dependencies rather than a hub-like pattern where there would be dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
