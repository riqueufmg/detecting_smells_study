    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VoidType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class VoidType has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (20), which does not indicate a hub-like structure. A hub-like modularization would require a significantly larger number of dependencies in both directions, suggesting centralization. The dependencies are also typical for a type node in an AST, interacting with visitors, meta-models, and resolution components, which is expected behavior and not indicative of a hub."
