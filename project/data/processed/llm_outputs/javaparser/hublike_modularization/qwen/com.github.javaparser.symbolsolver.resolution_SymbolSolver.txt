    "justification": "The class 'SymbolSolver' has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'SymbolSolver' acts as a central hub connecting various parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
