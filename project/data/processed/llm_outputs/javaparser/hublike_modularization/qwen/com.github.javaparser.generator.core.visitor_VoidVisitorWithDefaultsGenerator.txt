{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.VoidVisitorWithDefaultsGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 different classes, and each of these classes also have multiple outgoing dependencies. Specifically, MethodDeclaration has dependencies to 21 other classes, CompilationUnit has dependencies to 30 other classes, BlockStmt has dependencies to 9 other classes, SourceRoot has dependencies to 9 other classes, and BaseNodeMetaModel has dependencies to 3 other classes. This creates a hub-like structure where the analyzed class is connected to a large number of other abstractions through its direct and indirect dependencies."
