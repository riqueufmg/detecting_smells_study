    "class": "foo.bar.differentpackage.AClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (AnInterface and BinaryExpr) and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) indicates this is not a hub-like abstraction that connects to a large number of other abstractions."
