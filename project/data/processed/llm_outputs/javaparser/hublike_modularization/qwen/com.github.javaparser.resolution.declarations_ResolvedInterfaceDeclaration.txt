    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies but receives incoming dependencies from 5 different classes across multiple packages. The incoming dependencies include numerous types from various packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel', and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations'. This indicates that ResolvedInterfaceDeclaration is a central abstraction with a high number of incoming dependencies, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
