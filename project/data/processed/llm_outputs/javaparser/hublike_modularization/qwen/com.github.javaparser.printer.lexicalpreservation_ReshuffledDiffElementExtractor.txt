    "justification": "The class 'ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and 1 inner class, and it is also depended upon by the 'Difference' class. The number of dependencies (both outgoing and incoming) indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
