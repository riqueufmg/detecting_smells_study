    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'SubtypeOfBound' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (2). The outgoing dependencies are to 'ResolvedType', 'TypeHelper', and 'InferenceVariableSubstitution'. The incoming dependencies are from 'TypeInference' and 'BoundSet'. While it interacts with key components in the type inference module, the number of direct dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no indication of it acting as a central hub coordinating a large portion of the system. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
