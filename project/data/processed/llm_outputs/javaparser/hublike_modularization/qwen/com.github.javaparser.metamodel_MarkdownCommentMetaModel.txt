    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel.MarkdownCommentMetaModel' has no outgoing dependencies and only two incoming dependencies from external classes. This limited number of dependencies does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
