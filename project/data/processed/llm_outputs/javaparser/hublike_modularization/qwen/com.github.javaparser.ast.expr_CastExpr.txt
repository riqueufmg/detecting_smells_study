    "justification": "The class CastExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (37). It depends on various core classes such as Type, Node, Expression, and multiple visitor classes. Additionally, many other classes in the system depend on CastExpr, including various visitors and adapters, indicating it is a central point of interaction. This extensive connectivity both incoming and outgoing classifies it as hub-like modularization."
