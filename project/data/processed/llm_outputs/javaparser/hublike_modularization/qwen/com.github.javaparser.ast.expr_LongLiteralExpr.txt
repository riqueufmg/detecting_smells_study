    "justification": "The class LongLiteralExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (7) and incoming dependencies (24). While it is used by many visitor classes, the number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization. The dependencies are also typical for a node in an AST, interacting with visitors, meta-model classes, and utility classes."
