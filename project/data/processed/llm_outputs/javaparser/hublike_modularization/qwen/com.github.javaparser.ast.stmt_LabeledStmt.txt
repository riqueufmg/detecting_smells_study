    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.LabeledStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class LabeledStmt has a relatively small number of outgoing and incoming dependencies. Outgoing dependencies are limited to essential classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, LabeledStmtMetaModel, visitor classes, Range, TokenRange, Statement, SimpleName, and ObservableProperty. Incoming dependencies come from a manageable set of visitors and adapters. The dependency count does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not excessively connected to a large number of other abstractions."
