    "justification": "The class 'TypeSolverBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes: 'JarTypeSolver', 'AarTypeSolver', 'JavaParserTypeSolver', 'TypeSolver', 'ReflectionTypeSolver', and 'ClassLoaderTypeSolver'. This indicates that it interacts with a large number of other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
