    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.naming.NameRole",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NameRole has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from NameLogic. The incoming dependency from NameLogic shows 11 dependencies but these represent the dependencies of NameLogic itself, not dependencies on NameRole. Since NameRole has minimal dependencies (0 outgoing, 1 incoming), it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
