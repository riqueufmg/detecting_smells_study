    "justification": "The class 'EnumDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (14) and incoming dependencies (64), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive connectivity, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, suggests a hub-like role in the system architecture, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
