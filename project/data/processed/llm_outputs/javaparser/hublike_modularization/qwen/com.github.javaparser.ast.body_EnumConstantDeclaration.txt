    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'EnumConstantDeclaration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (12) and incoming dependencies (43). It interacts with numerous classes across different packages, including various visitor classes, meta-model classes, and AST node types. This extensive web of dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, centralizing interactions between multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
