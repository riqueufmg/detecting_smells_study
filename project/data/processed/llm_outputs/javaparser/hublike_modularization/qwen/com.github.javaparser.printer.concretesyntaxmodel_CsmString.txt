    "justification": "The class CsmString has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to Node, ObservableProperty, and SourcePrinter, which are not numerous enough to indicate hub-like modularization. None of the dependencies show a pattern of excessive coupling or centralization that would suggest this class acts as a hub within the system."
