{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithThrownExceptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ReferenceType, StaticJavaParser, and NodeList, which are reasonable for a class dealing with thrown exceptions in an AST. The lack of incoming dependencies indicates it is not a central hub. Hub-like Modularization requires both a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is not present here."
