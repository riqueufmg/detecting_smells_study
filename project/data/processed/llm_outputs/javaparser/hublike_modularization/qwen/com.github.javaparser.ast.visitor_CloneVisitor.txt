    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.CloneVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CloneVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 133 other classes, which indicates a high number of dependencies. Additionally, it has 0 incoming dependencies, meaning no other classes depend on it. This pattern of high outgoing dependencies with low incoming dependencies is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization, where the class acts as a central hub interacting with many other components but not being depended upon by others."
