    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of incoming dependencies, including numerous meta-model classes and AST node types, indicating it is widely used across the system. It also has outgoing dependencies to core meta-model abstractions such as PropertyMetaModel and BaseNodeMetaModel, suggesting it interacts with many other parts of the system both in terms of usage and implementation, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
