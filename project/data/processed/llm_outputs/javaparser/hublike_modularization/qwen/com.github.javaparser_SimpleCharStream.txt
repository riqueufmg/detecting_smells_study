    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SimpleCharStream' has incoming dependencies from a large number of other abstractions (e.g., GeneratedJavaParser and GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager), indicating it acts as a hub. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to multiple classes such as 'Provider', further supporting its role as a central point in the modularization."
