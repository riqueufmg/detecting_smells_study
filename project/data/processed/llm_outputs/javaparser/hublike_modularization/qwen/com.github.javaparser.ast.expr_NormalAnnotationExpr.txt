    "justification": "The class 'NormalAnnotationExpr' has a large number of outgoing dependencies (13) and incoming dependencies (35+ across multiple classes), indicating it interacts with many other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This high degree of connectivity, both incoming and outgoing, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
