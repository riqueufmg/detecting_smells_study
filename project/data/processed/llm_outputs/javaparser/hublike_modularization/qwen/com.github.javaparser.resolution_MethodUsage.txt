    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.MethodUsage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MethodUsage' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 25 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MethodUsage' acts as a hub, connecting numerous abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
