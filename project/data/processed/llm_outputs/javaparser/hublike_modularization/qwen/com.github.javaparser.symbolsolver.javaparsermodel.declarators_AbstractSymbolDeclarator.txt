    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarators.AbstractSymbolDeclarator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to TypeSolver and 0 incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with other abstractions does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other classes."
