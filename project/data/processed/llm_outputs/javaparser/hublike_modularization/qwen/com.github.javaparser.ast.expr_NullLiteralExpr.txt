    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class NullLiteralExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (18). The outgoing dependencies are to core infrastructure classes (Range, TokenRange), meta-model classes (NullLiteralExprMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel), and visitor classes (GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor). The incoming dependencies come from various visitor implementations and utility classes, which is typical for a node in an AST. The number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as a hub-like modularization smell."
