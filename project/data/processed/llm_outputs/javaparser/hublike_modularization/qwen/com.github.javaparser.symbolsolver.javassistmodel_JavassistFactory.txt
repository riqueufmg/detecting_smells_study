{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JavassistFactory has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes and incoming dependencies from 10 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that JavassistFactory acts as a hub, centralizing interactions between multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
