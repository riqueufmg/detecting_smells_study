    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (30) and incoming dependencies (50), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This extensive connectivity suggests hub-like behavior where the class acts as a central point of interaction within the system."
