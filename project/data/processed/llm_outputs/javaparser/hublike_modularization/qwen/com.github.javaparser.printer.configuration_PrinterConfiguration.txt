    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrinterConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'PrinterConfiguration' has incoming dependencies from 10 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 class. The high number of incoming dependencies (10) indicates that many other abstractions depend on it, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
