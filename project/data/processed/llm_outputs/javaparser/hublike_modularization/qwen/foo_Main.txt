{
    "class": "foo.Main",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class foo.Main has only one outgoing dependency to foo.Foo and no incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
