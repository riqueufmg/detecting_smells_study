    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ModuleDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (ModuleDeclaration and JavaParserMetaModel). While JavaParserMetaModel has many dependencies, the ModuleDeclarationMetaModel itself does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction. Hub-like Modularization requires the class to have many direct dependencies both incoming and outgoing, which is not the case here."
