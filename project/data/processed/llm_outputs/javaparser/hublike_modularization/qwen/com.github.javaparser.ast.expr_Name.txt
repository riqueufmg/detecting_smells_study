    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Name' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 67 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
