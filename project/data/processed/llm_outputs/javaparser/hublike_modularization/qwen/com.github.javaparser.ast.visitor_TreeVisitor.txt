    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.TreeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'com.github.javaparser.ast.Node' and no incoming dependencies. The large number of dependencies listed under 'Node' are not direct dependencies of 'TreeVisitor', but rather dependencies of the 'Node' class itself. Therefore, 'TreeVisitor' does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization as it does not have direct dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
