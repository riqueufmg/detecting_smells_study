    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes, and one of its dependencies, JavaParserFacade, itself has outgoing dependencies to 45 other classes. This creates a hub-like structure where JavaParserConstructorDeclaration depends on a large number of abstractions through direct and indirect dependencies, indicating Hub-like Modularization."
