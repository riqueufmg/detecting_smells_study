    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class HashCodeVisitorGenerator has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and no incoming dependencies. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Although there are no incoming dependencies, the outgoing dependencies alone are sufficient to indicate the smell due to the class acting as a central hub connecting to many other components."
