    "justification": "The class TypeParameter has a large number of outgoing dependencies (13) and incoming dependencies (50+). It depends on various core classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, Range, GenericVisitor, ResolvedTypeVariable, VoidVisitor, NodeList, TokenRange, ResolvedType, Context, SimpleName, TypeParameterMetaModel, ObservableProperty, and numerous visitor and adapter classes. Additionally, it is depended upon by a wide range of classes across different packages including visitors, declaration adapters, contexts, and parsers. This extensive bidirectional dependency network indicates hub-like modularization."
