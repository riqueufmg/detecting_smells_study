    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (3). The dependencies are focused on related validation components and core AST nodes, which is typical for a validator class. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
