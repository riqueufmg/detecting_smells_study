    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NameExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'NameExpr' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (64). The outgoing dependencies include central classes like 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'Node', 'GenericVisitor', and 'VoidVisitor'. The incoming dependencies come from numerous classes across different packages, particularly from visitors and symbol solvers, indicating that 'NameExpr' is widely used and interconnected. This extensive bidirectional dependency network qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
