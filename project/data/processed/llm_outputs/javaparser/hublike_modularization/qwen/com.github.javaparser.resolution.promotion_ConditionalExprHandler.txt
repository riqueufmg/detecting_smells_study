    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 class (ResolvedType) which itself has 9 outgoing dependencies, and incoming dependencies from 2 classes (TypeExtractor and ConditionalExprResolver) where TypeExtractor has 64 dependencies and ConditionalExprResolver has 3 dependencies. This indicates the class acts as a hub with significant incoming and outgoing connections."
