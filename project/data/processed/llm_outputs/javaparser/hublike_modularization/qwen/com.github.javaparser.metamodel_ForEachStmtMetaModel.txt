    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (from ForEachStmt and JavaParserMetaModel). While JavaParserMetaModel has many dependencies, the ForEachStmtMetaModel itself does not exhibit a large number of direct dependencies in either direction. The incoming dependencies are only from two other classes, and there is only one outgoing dependency, which does not meet the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
