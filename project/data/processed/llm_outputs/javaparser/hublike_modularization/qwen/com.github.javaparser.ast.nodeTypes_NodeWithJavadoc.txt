    "justification": "The class NodeWithJavadoc has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. None of the outgoing dependencies show extensive dependency chains that would suggest this class is acting as a hub."
