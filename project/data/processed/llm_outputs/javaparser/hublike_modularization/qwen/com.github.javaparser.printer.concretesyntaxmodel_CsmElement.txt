    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CsmElement has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 12 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that CsmElement acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
