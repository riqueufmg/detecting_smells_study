    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ConstructorDeclarationMetaModel' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'ConstructorDeclaration' and 'JavaParserMetaModel', which itself depends on a large number of meta-model classes. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'PropertyMetaModel', which also connects to numerous other classes. This pattern of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with many abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
