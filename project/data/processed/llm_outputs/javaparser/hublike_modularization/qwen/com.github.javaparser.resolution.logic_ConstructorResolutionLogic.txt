    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.ConstructorResolutionLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ConstructorResolutionLogic' has outgoing dependencies to 5 different classes and incoming dependencies from 2 different classes. The outgoing dependencies include 'ResolvedConstructorDeclaration', 'MethodResolutionLogic', 'TypeSolver', 'ResolvedType', and 'SymbolReference'. The incoming dependencies come from 'JavaParserFacade' and 'JavaParserTypeDeclarationAdapter'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions."
