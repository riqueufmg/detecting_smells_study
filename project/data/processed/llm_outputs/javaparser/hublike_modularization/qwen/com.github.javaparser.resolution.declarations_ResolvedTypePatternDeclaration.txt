    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypePatternDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from ResolvedDeclaration, which itself depends on multiple declaration classes. The class does not exhibit hub-like behavior as it has minimal connections (0 outgoing, 1 incoming) and does not serve as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
