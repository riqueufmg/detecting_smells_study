    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ResolvedReferenceType' has outgoing dependencies to 10 other classes and incoming dependencies from 34 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
