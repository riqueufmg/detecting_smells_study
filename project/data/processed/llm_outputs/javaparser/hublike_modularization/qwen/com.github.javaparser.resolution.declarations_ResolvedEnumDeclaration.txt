    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including JavaSymbolSolver, FieldAccessContext, EnumDeclaration, and ResolvedTypeDeclaration, indicating a large number of abstractions depend on it. It also has outgoing dependencies to ResolvedEnumConstantDeclaration. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
