    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ParseException has incoming dependencies from 5 different classes (SourceFileInfoExtractor, JavaParser, ParseStart, GeneratedJavaParserBase, GeneratedJavaParser, and Widget), which indicates a high number of abstractions depending on it. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to Token. This pattern of having many incoming dependencies and at least one outgoing dependency classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
