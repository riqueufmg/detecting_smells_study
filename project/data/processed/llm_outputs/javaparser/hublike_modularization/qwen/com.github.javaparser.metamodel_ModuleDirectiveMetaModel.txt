    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ModuleDirectiveMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ModuleDirectiveMetaModel' has no outgoing dependencies but has incoming dependencies from multiple classes, including 'ModuleDirective' and 'JavaParserMetaModel'. The 'JavaParserMetaModel' class alone depends on 100+ other classes, indicating that 'ModuleDirectiveMetaModel' is part of a highly interconnected module. This pattern of having numerous incoming dependencies without outgoing ones suggests hub-like behavior where this class acts as a central point in the dependency structure."
