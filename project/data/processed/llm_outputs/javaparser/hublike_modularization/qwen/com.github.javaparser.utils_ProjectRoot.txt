    "justification": "The class 'ProjectRoot' has a limited number of incoming and outgoing dependencies. It depends on only one class ('ParserConfiguration') directly, and while that class has several dependencies, those are not counted as direct dependencies of 'ProjectRoot'. Additionally, 'ProjectRoot' is depended upon by a small number of other classes ('SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy', 'CollectionStrategy', 'ParserCollectionStrategy', and 'Main'), which do not indicate an excessive or hub-like dependency pattern."
