    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ArrayType has a large number of outgoing dependencies (18) and incoming dependencies (49), indicating it interacts with many other abstractions both in terms of usage and being used. This high degree of connectivity suggests hub-like modularization where ArrayType acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
