    "class": "issue1945.main.MainIssue1945",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies to interfaces (HairTypeRenderer, HairyAnimal, HairType) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like behavior where a single class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
