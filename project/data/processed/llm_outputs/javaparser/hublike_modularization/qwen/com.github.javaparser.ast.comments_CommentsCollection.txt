{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.CommentsCollection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class CommentsCollection has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (Range, BlockComment, Comment, LineComment, JavadocComment) and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes (ParseResult, JavaParser, GeneratedJavaParserBase, GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions in the system."
