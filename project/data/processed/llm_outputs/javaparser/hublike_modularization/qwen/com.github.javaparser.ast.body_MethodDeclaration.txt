    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class MethodDeclaration has a large number of outgoing dependencies (20) and incoming dependencies (69), indicating it interacts with many other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This high degree of connectivity suggests hub-like modularization where MethodDeclaration acts as a central point connecting numerous other components in the system."
