    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (20), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it. This extensive dependency network suggests hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
