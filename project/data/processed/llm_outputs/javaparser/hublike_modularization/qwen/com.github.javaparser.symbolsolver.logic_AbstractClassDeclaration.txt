    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic.AbstractClassDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ResolvedClassDeclaration and ResolvedReferenceType. While ResolvedReferenceType itself has many dependencies, this does not indicate hub-like modularization for AbstractClassDeclaration since it only directly depends on two abstractions."
