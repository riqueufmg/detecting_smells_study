    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'IfStatementContext' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes and no incoming dependencies. The number of outgoing dependencies is high, indicating that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Although there are no incoming dependencies, the significant number of outgoing dependencies alone is sufficient to classify it as a hub-like module."
