    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'BoundSet' has outgoing dependencies to 19 other classes and incoming dependencies from 12 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'BoundSet' acts as a hub within the module, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
