    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to Expression) and 0 incoming dependencies. The Expression class itself has many dependencies, but that does not indicate Hub-like Modularization for NodeWithScope. For Hub-like Modularization to be detected, the class itself should have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
