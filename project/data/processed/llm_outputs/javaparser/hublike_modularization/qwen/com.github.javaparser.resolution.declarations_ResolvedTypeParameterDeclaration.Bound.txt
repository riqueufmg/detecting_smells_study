    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to ResolvedType and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency ResolvedType itself has multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class Bound only directly depends on one abstraction. There is no evidence of hub-like modularization where the class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
