    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DoubleLiteralExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (20+ classes, but these represent visitors and utilities acting upon it, which is typical). The dependencies are not excessively wide or diverse, and the class does not act as a central hub connecting a large number of unrelated abstractions. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
