    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.MetaModelGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MetaModelGenerator' has outgoing dependencies to 14 different classes and incoming dependencies from 3 different classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
