    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CommentsInserter' has outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JavaParser'). The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as 'Node', 'CompilationUnit', 'ParserConfiguration', and 'Comment', indicating it interacts with a wide range of abstractions. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
