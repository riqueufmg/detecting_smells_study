    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.PropertyChange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to 'com.github.javaparser.ast.Node' and 'com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty'. While these classes themselves have many dependencies, the PropertyChange class does not directly depend on a large number of abstractions, nor does it serve as a hub with many incoming dependencies."
