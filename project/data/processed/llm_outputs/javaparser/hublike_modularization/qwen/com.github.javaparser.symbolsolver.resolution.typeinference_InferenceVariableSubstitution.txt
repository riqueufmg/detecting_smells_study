    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariableSubstitution",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'InferenceVariableSubstitution' has outgoing dependencies to 'InferenceVariable' and 'ResolvedType', and incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'Bound', 'SubtypeOfBound', 'CapturesBound', 'SameAsBound', 'FalseBound', and 'ThrowsBound'. This indicates it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
