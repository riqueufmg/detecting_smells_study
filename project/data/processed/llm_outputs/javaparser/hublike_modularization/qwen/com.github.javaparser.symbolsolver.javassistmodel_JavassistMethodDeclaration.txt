    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 10 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other abstraction (JavassistUtils), which indicates it acts as a hub connecting multiple components. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies suggests hub-like modularization."
