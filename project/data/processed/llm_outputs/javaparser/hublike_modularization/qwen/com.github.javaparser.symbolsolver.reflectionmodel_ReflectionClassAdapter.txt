    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ReflectionClassAdapter' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes. The total number of dependencies (12) is significantly high, indicating hub-like modularization. The class interacts with multiple abstractions across different packages, including 'ReferenceTypeImpl', 'ResolvedType', 'TypeSolver', 'ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration', 'ResolvedFieldDeclaration', 'ReflectionFactory', and others, both as a client and as a provider of functionality. This central role in managing dependencies suggests it acts as a hub."
