```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType.ArrayBracketPair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (TokenRange and NodeList) and 1 incoming dependency (ArrayType). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate a hub-like pattern where a class would have a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies with many other abstractions."
