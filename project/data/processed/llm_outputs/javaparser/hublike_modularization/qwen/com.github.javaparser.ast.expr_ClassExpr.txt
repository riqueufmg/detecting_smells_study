    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ClassExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ClassExpr class has a large number of outgoing dependencies (9) and incoming dependencies (24). The outgoing dependencies include core classes such as Range, ClassExprMetaModel, Node, ObservableProperty, JavaParserMetaModel, GenericVisitor, Type, VoidVisitor, and TokenRange. The incoming dependencies consist of numerous visitor classes, adapter classes, and other components from the JavaParser library, indicating that ClassExpr is widely used and interacts with many other abstractions both in terms of usage and implementation. This extensive bidirectional interaction confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
