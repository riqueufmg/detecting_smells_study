    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.EnumConstantDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 other class. While the number of direct dependencies is relatively low, the incoming dependencies include JavaParserMetaModel which itself has a very large number of dependencies (70+), indicating that EnumConstantDeclarationMetaModel acts as a central point in the modularization structure. Additionally, it's part of the metamodel package where many meta-classes depend on each other, creating a hub-like pattern where this class serves as a connection point between different parts of the system."
