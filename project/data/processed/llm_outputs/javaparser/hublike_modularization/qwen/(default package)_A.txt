    "justification": "Class A has only 1 outgoing dependency to com.github.javaparser.quality.Preconditions and 1 incoming dependency from (default package).B. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with other abstractions does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not acting as a central hub connecting to a large number of other classes."
