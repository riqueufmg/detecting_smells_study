    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java9Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Validator and SingleNodeTypeValidator) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
