    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (LambdaExpr and JavaParserMetaModel). The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of it acting as a central hub with numerous connections to many other abstractions."
