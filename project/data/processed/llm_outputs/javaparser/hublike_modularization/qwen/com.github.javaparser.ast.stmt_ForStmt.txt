    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ForStmt' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (11) and incoming dependencies (25). It interacts with numerous classes across different packages, including visitor classes, meta-model classes, expression classes, statement classes, and others. This extensive web of dependencies indicates that 'ForStmt' acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions both upstream and downstream, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
