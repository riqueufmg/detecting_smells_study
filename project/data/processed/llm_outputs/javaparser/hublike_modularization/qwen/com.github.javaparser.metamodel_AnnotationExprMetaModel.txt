    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.AnnotationExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to PropertyMetaModel) and two incoming dependencies (from AnnotationExpr and JavaParserMetaModel). While JavaParserMetaModel shows a large number of dependencies, the AnnotationExprMetaModel itself does not exhibit a high number of direct dependencies in both incoming and outgoing directions. Hub-like Modularization requires the class in question to have many dependencies in both directions, which is not the case here."
