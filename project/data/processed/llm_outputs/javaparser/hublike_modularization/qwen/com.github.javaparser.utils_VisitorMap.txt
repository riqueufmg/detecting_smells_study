    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorMap",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorMap' exhibits Hub-like Modularization because it has a high number of outgoing dependencies (64) to various classes in the 'com.github.javaparser.ast' package, indicating it interacts with a large number of abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from at least one other class, 'VisitorMap.EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade', which further supports its role as a central hub in the modularization structure."
