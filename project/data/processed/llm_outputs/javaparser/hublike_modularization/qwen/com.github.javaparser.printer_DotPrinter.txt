    "justification": "The class DotPrinter has only outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (NodeList, LineSeparator, NodeMetaModel, Node), which is not a large number. There are no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
