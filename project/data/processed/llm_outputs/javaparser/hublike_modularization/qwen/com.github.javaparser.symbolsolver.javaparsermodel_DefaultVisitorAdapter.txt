    "justification": "The class 'DefaultVisitorAdapter' has outgoing dependencies to 125 other classes, as listed in the 'dependencies' array. This large number of dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a wide variety of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. The class serves as a central point that connects to many other components, fulfilling the criteria for this smell."
