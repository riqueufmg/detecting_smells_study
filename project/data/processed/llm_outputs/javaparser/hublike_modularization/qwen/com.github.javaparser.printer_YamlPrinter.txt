{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.YamlPrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class YamlPrinter has only 3 outgoing dependencies (NodeList, NodeMetaModel, Node) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
