    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class SwitchExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (35). It depends on multiple core classes such as VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, NodeList, Node, ObservableProperty, Expression, SwitchEntry, JavaParserMetaModel, and TokenRange. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor classes and other components, indicating it acts as a hub in the modularization structure."
