    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DoStatementContext has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to closely related classes within the same package or directly related packages, which is typical for a context-specific class handling do-statement logic. There is no evidence of excessive or hub-like dependency connections that would indicate Hub-like Modularization."
