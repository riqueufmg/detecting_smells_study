    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'AccessSpecifier' has no outgoing dependencies and is only referenced by 30 other classes as an incoming dependency. While it is used by many classes, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization because it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions. The incoming dependencies indicate it is a commonly used utility or enum, but this alone does not constitute hub-like behavior."
