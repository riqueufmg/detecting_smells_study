    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.CallableDeclaration.Signature",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class CallableDeclaration. The incoming dependencies show that CallableDeclaration depends on 12 different classes/abstractions, but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship, not multiple incoming dependencies from different sources. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependency connections."
