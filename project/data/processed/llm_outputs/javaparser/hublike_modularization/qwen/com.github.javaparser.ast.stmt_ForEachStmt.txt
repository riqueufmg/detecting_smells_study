    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ForEachStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ForEachStmt has a high number of outgoing dependencies (13) and incoming dependencies (35). It depends on various core classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, GenericVisitor, VariableDeclarator, VoidVisitor, ForEachStmtMetaModel, VariableDeclarationExpr, TokenRange, Modifier, Expression, BlockStmt, Statement, and ObservableProperty. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor classes, factory classes, and context classes across different packages, indicating it is a central component interacted with by many other parts of the system. This pattern of having many incoming and outgoing dependencies confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
