    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class SwitchStmt has a high number of outgoing dependencies (11) and incoming dependencies (43). It depends on various core classes such as JavaParserMetaModel, Node, Range, GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, NodeList, SwitchEntry, SwitchStmtMetaModel, TokenRange, Expression, and ObservableProperty. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitors, adapters, and other components across different packages like symbolsolver, visitor, printer, and generator. This extensive bidirectional dependency network indicates hub-like modularization."
