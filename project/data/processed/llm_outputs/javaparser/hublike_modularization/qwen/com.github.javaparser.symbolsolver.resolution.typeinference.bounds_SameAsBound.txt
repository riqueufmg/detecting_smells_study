    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.SameAsBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'SameAsBound' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to 'ResolvedType', 'TypeHelper', and 'InferenceVariableSubstitution'. The incoming dependencies come only from 'BoundSet'. The number of dependencies is not excessive, and there is no evidence of hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
