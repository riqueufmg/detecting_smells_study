    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to StaticJavaParser, Utils, and Name classes, which is not a large number of dependencies. There are no incoming dependencies indicating other classes do not depend on this class. Therefore, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
