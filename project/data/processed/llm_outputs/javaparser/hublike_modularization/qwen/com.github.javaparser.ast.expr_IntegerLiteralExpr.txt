    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.IntegerLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class IntegerLiteralExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (7) and incoming dependencies (24). The outgoing dependencies are to core infrastructure classes such as Range, TokenRange, and visitor classes, which is typical for AST node classes. The incoming dependencies come primarily from visitor implementations, parsers, and printer classes, which is expected behavior for a node in an AST hierarchy. While it has multiple dependencies, the number is not excessive relative to the CONTEXT_SIZE of 35208, and the dependencies are focused on related functionality (parsing, visiting, printing). This does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have an unusually large number of diverse dependencies."
