    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'GenericListVisitorAdapter' has outgoing dependencies to 93 different classes across various packages, indicating a high number of dependencies. Additionally, it has 0 incoming dependencies, which means it is not depended upon by other classes. This pattern of high outgoing dependencies with no incoming dependencies suggests hub-like modularization, where the class acts as a central hub connecting to many other classes."
