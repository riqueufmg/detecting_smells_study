    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class WhileStmt has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (39). While some dependencies exist, they are not excessively numerous to qualify as hub-like modularization. The dependencies are focused on related AST node types and visitor patterns, which is typical for a statement node in a parser library. There is no evidence of excessive or centralizing dependency relationships that would indicate hub-like behavior."
