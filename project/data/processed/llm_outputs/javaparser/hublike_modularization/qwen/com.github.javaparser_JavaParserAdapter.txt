    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParserAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserAdapter' has outgoing dependencies to 23 other classes and 1 incoming dependency from 'StaticJavaParser'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
