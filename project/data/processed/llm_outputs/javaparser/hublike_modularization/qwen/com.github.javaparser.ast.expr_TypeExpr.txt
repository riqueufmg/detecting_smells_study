    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TypeExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TypeExpr has dependencies on 9 other classes and is depended upon by 24 other classes. This high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that TypeExpr acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
