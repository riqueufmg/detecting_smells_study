    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer.JsonNode' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of outgoing dependencies (84) to various meta-model classes in the 'com.github.javaparser.metamodel' package, indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'JavaParserJsonSerializer', further establishing its role as a central hub in the serialization module."
