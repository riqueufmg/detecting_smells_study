    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.other.BndGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to SourceRoot and no incoming dependencies. While SourceRoot itself has multiple dependencies, the BndGenerator class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
