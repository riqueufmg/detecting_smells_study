    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Utils and SimpleName) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies show that NodeWithOptionalLabel depends on 2 other classes, which is not a large number indicating hub-like behavior. There are no incoming dependencies from other classes, meaning this class is not a central hub that many other classes depend on."
