    "justification": "The class 'com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParser' has a high number of outgoing dependencies (79) and incoming dependencies (2), indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions. This extensive interaction pattern, both in terms of classes it depends on and classes that depend on it, is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization where the class acts as a central hub in the system architecture."
