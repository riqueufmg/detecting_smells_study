    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.FunctionalInterfaceLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes. The total number of dependencies (incoming and outgoing) is 10, which indicates a high level of connectivity. Additionally, the incoming dependencies span multiple packages such as 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts', 'com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference', and 'com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem', showing that this class is widely used across different parts of the system. This pattern of having numerous incoming and outgoing connections qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
