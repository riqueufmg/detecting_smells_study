    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistMethodLikeDeclarationAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 2 other abstractions. The outgoing dependencies include core resolution types and declarations such as ResolvedType, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, TypeSolver, and ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, indicating broad interaction with the type resolution system. The incoming dependencies come from related method and constructor declarations, showing that this class is central to adapting method-like declarations. The combination of multiple outgoing and incoming dependencies across different abstraction levels indicates hub-like behavior."
