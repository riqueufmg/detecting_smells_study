    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedVoidType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ResolvedVoidType has only one outgoing dependency to ResolvedType and is depended upon by 5 other classes. The outgoing dependencies of ResolvedType show it connects to 9 other types, but this does not indicate that ResolvedVoidType itself has a large number of direct dependencies. The incoming dependencies show that 5 other classes depend on ResolvedVoidType, which is not a high number. Therefore, ResolvedVoidType does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
