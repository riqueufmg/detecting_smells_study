    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class StringLiteralExpr has a high number of outgoing dependencies (8) and incoming dependencies (24). It depends on various core classes such as Range, Utils, JavaParserMetaModel, and visitor classes. Additionally, it is depended upon by numerous visitor implementations and other components like TypeExtractor and DefaultVisitorAdapter, indicating it's a central point of interaction. This wide range of dependencies both incoming and outgoing suggests hub-like modularization."
