    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BlockComment has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (18), which does not indicate a hub-like structure. Hub-like modularization typically involves a class with a very high number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, acting as a central point of communication. In this case, the dependencies are manageable and specific to comment-related functionality."
