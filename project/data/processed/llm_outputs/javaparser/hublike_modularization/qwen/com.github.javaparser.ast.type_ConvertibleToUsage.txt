    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (ResolvedType and Context) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the analyzed class does not directly depend on those nested dependencies. The number of direct dependencies is low, not indicating hub-like modularization."
