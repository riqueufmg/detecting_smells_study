    "justification": "The class RecordPatternExpr has dependencies on 10 other classes (VoidVisitor, NodeList, Node, ObservableProperty, ReferenceType, RecordPatternExprMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel, Type, GenericVisitor, TokenRange), and is also depended upon by 20 other classes including various visitors and parsers. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
