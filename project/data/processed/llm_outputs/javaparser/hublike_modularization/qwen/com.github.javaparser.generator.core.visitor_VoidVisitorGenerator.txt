{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.VoidVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 different classes, and the dependent classes themselves have numerous outgoing dependencies. For example, CompilationUnit has dependencies to 24 other classes, SourceRoot has dependencies to 9 other classes, MethodDeclaration has dependencies to 21 other classes, and BaseNodeMetaModel has dependencies to 3 other classes. This creates a hub-like structure where VoidVisitorGenerator connects to a large number of abstractions through its direct and indirect dependencies."
