    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TextBlockLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class TextBlockLiteralExpr has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (20). The outgoing dependencies are to specific utility and meta-model classes, and the incoming dependencies are primarily from visitor and parser classes which is typical for AST node classes. This dependency pattern does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have excessive dependencies in both directions."
