    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ObservableProperty' has incoming dependencies from 67 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ObservableProperty' acts as a hub, connecting a large number of abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
