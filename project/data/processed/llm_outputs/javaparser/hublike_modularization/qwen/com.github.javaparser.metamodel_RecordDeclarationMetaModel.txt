    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.RecordDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RecordDeclarationMetaModel' has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes ('RecordDeclaration' and 'JavaParserMetaModel') and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('PropertyMetaModel'). The incoming dependency from 'JavaParserMetaModel' includes a large number of dependencies (85), indicating that 'RecordDeclarationMetaModel' is involved in a hub-like structure where it is referenced by a central meta-model class that manages many other meta-models. This pattern of being a central reference point with numerous incoming dependencies qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
