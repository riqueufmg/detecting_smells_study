    "justification": "The class 'ClassOrInterfaceTypeMetaModel' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'JavaParserMetaModel' which depends on a large number of other meta models, and it also has outgoing dependencies to 'PropertyMetaModel'. This pattern of having both numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
