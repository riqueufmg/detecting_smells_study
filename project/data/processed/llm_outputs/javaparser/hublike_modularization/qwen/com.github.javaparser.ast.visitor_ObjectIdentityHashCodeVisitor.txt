    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ObjectIdentityHashCodeVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 85 other classes, which indicates a high number of dependencies. This large number of outgoing dependencies suggests that the class interacts with many other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
