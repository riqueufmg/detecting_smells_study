    "class": "com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonDeserializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JavaParserJsonDeserializer' has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes, including 'NodeList', 'StaticJavaParser', 'Node', 'PropertyMetaModel', 'CompilationUnit', 'Position', 'JavaParserMetaModel', 'BaseNodeMetaModel', and 'JavaToken'. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that the class interacts with a wide variety of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, there are no incoming dependencies, suggesting it is a central point that reaches out to many other components without being heavily relied upon by others, reinforcing the hub-like behavior."
