    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class CombinedTypeSolver. The incoming dependency contains 7 dependencies but these represent usage within a single source relationship, not multiple abstraction dependencies. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics as it has minimal dependency connections."
