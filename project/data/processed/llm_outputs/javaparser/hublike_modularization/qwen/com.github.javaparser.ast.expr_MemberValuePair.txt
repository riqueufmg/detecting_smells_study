    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MemberValuePair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MemberValuePair has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (10) and incoming dependencies (21). While it interacts with several visitor classes and core AST classes, the number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization. The dependencies are typical for a node in an AST that needs to integrate with visitors, meta-models, and core node types. There is no evidence of excessive or centralizing dependencies that would indicate hub-like behavior."
