    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.HotThrowTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IMetaMember, and HotThrowFinder, which are reasonable collaborators for a top list visitable implementation. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of dependencies in either direction."
