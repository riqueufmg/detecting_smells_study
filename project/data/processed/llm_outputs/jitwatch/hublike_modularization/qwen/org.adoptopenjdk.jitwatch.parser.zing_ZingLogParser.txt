    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ZingLogParser has outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes across multiple packages. It depends on IJITListener, NumberedLine, ZingLine, ParseUtil, CompilerThread, ZingLineType, and Tag. Among these, ParseUtil itself has dependencies to 11 other classes, and ZingLine has dependencies to 6 other classes, indicating that ZingLogParser is connected to a large number of abstractions through its direct and indirect dependencies. This creates a hub-like structure where ZingLogParser acts as a central point interacting with many other components."
