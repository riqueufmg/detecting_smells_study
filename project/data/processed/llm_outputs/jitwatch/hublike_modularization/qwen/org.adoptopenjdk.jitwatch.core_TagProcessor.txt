    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.TagProcessor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The incoming dependency class (AbstractLogParser) itself has dependencies on 16 other abstractions, indicating it is a hub. TagProcessor interacts with multiple core model classes (Task, Tag) and utility classes (StringUtil, Opcode, JITWatchConstants), showing it connects to various parts of the system. The combination of multiple outgoing dependencies to different packages and being a dependency of a hub class (AbstractLogParser) indicates hub-like behavior where TagProcessor acts as an intermediary connecting different parts of the system."
