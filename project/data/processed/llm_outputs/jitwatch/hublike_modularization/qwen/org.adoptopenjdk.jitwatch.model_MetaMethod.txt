{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaMethod",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class MetaMethod has only one outgoing dependency to MetaClass and is only depended upon by JITDataModel. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
