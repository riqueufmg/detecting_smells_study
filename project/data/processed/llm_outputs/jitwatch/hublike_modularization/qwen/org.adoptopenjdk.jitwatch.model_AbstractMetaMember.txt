    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class AbstractMetaMember has outgoing dependencies to 9 different classes: AssemblyMethod, MetaClass, Compilation, ParseUtil, ClassBC, StringUtil, MemberSignatureParts, IMetaMember, and MemberBytecode. This high number of outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it interacts directly with many other abstractions in the system."
