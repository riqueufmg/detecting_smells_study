    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount.SequenceCountOperation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SequenceCountOperation' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JarScan') which itself depends on 11 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions."
