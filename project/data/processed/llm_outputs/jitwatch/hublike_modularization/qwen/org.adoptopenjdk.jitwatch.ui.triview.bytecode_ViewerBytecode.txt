    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ViewerBytecode' has outgoing dependencies to 21 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TriView'). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ViewerBytecode' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
