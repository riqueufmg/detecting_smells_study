    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from ViewerAssembly lists many classes but only directly depends on AssemblyReference among the listed classes. The number of dependencies is not excessive relative to the context size of 750, and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
