    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class BytecodeLoader has outgoing dependencies to 19 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
