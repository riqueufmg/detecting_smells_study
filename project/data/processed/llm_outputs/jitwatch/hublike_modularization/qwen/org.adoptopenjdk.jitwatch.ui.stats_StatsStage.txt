    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stats.StatsStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'StatsStage' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JITWatchUI'). The dependent class 'JITWatchUI' itself has a large number of outgoing dependencies (30+), indicating it is a hub-like class. 'StatsStage' directly interacts with this hub and also depends on multiple other abstractions, contributing to hub-like modularization where it acts as a secondary hub or is tightly coupled to a central hub."
