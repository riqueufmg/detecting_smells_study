    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.ReportType' has incoming dependencies from 8 different classes across multiple packages, including 'Report', 'AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker', 'SuggestionWalker', 'InliningWalker', 'ViewerBytecode', 'EliminatedAllocationRowBean', 'OptimisedLockRowBean', and 'InliningRowBean'. This indicates that a large number of other abstractions depend on this class, which is a key indicator of Hub-like Modularization."
