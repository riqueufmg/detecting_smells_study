    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes, and one of those classes (JITWatchUI) itself has outgoing dependencies to 31 other classes. This creates a hub-like structure where AbstractTextViewerStage connects to a large number of abstractions through its direct and indirect dependencies."
