    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (JITWatchUI and StringUtil) and incoming dependencies from 1 class (JITWatchUI). The dependency with JITWatchUI is particularly significant as it involves a large number of other abstractions (34 dependencies listed), indicating hub-like behavior where TextViewerStage acts as a central point connecting to many other components."
