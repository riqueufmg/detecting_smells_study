    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ClassBC",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassBC' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 8 other classes. The total number of dependencies (13) is significantly high, indicating that 'ClassBC' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. Additionally, it is involved in dependencies with classes across different packages such as 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model', and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview', further supporting the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
