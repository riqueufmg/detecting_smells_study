    "justification": "The class J9Line has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (2). The dependencies are focused on related classes within the same package and model layer. There is no evidence of excessive or broad dependency connections that would indicate hub-like behavior. The class does not act as a central hub connecting to a large number of unrelated abstractions."
