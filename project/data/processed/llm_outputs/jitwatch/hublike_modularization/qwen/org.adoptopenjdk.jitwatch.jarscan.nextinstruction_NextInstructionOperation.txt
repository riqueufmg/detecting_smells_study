{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionOperation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (JarScan) which itself has dependencies on 11 different abstractions. This indicates that NextInstructionOperation is connected to a large number of other abstractions both directly and indirectly through JarScan, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
