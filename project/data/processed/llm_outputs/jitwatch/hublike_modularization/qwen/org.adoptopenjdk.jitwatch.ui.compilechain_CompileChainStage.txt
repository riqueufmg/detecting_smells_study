    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain.CompileChainStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency from JITWatchUI, which itself has 30 outgoing dependencies and is a central class in the UI module. CompileChainStage interacts with multiple core abstractions including CompileChainWalker, IStageAccessProxy, RateLimitedResizeListener, UserInterfaceUtil, Compilation, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, JITWatchUI, CompilationChooser, CompileNode, IMetaMember, PlotNode, and IMemberSelectedListener. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
