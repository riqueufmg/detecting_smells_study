    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ClassMemberList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ClassMemberList' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JITWatchUI') which itself has dependencies to 26 other classes. This indicates that 'ClassMemberList' is a central point connecting to numerous abstractions both directly and indirectly through 'JITWatchUI', fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
