    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil' has incoming dependencies from 34 other classes across various packages, indicating it is widely used throughout the system. It also has no outgoing dependencies, which suggests it serves as a central utility for string operations without depending on other abstractions. This pattern of many incoming dependencies and no outgoing dependencies classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
