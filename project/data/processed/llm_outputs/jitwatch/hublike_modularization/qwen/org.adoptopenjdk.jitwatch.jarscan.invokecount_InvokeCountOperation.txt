    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount.InvokeCountOperation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class. The outgoing dependencies include core bytecode model classes (Opcode, BytecodeInstruction, MemberBytecode) and utility classes (ParseUtil), indicating it interacts with multiple abstraction layers. The incoming dependency from JarScan shows it is a central operation in the jar scanning functionality. This pattern of multiple outgoing dependencies to different conceptual modules and being depended upon by a central coordinating class indicates hub-like modularization."
