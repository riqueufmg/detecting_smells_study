    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (MemberBytecode and Opcode) and incoming dependencies from 1 class (JarScan). The outgoing dependency to MemberBytecode further expands to 10 additional dependencies, indicating a high number of outgoing connections. Additionally, the incoming dependency from JarScan includes 11 dependencies, showing a significant number of incoming connections. This pattern of multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
