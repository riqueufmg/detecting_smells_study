    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser.CompilationChooser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes and incoming dependencies from 2 classes. The outgoing dependencies include Compilation, IMetaMember, and IMemberSelectedListener. The incoming dependencies come from TriView and CompileChainStage. The class acts as a central point connecting multiple components, showing hub-like behavior by being involved in both incoming and outgoing interactions with a relatively large number of other abstractions."
