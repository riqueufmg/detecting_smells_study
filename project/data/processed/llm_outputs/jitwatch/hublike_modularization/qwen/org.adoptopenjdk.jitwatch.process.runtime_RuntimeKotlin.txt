    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeKotlin",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'RuntimeKotlin' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes ('CompilerKotlin', 'ResourceLoader', 'ILogListener') and is listed as a dependency in the incoming dependencies of 'LanguageManager', which itself has dependencies to 15 other classes. This indicates that 'RuntimeKotlin' is involved in a high number of dependencies both incoming and outgoing, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
