    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerKotlin",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (ILogListener) and 2 incoming dependencies (LanguageManager and RuntimeKotlin). While LanguageManager has many dependencies, that reflects LanguageManager's complexity, not CompilerKotlin's. CompilerKotlin itself does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
