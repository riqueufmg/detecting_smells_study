    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.EventType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes (AbstractLogParser and JITEvent) and outgoing dependencies to 0 classes. The incoming dependencies include a large number of different classes from different packages, indicating that this class is used by many other abstractions. This creates a hub-like structure where EventType acts as a central point connecting multiple components."
