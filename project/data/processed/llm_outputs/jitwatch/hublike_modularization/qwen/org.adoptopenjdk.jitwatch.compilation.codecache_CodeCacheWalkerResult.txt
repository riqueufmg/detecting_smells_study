    "justification": "The class 'CodeCacheWalkerResult' has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including 'CodeCacheEventWalker', 'JITWatchUI', and 'CodeCacheLayoutStage'. It also has outgoing dependencies to 'CodeCacheEvent' and its nested types. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
