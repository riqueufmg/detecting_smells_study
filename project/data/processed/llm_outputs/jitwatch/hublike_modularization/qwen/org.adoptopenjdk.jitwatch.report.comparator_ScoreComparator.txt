    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency to 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report' and two incoming dependencies from 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch.LaunchHeadless' and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI'. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
