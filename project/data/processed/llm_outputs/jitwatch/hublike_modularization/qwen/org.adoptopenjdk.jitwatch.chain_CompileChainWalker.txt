```json
{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain.CompileChainWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The outgoing dependencies include classes from different packages such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain. This indicates that the class interacts with a large number of other abstractions both in terms of providing services to them (incoming) and using their services (outgoing), which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
