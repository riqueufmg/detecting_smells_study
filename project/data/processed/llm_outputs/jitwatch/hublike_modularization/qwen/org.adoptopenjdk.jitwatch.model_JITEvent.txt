{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITEvent",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JITEvent has incoming dependencies from 6 different classes (LaunchHeadless, AbstractLogParser, JITDataModel, IJITListener, JITWatchUI, TimeLineStage) and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (IMetaMember, StringUtil, EventType). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that JITEvent acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
