    "justification": "The class ILineListener has only one outgoing dependency to ILineListener.LineType and is depended upon by four other classes (Viewer, ViewerAssembly, ViewerBytecode, ViewerSource). While it has multiple incoming dependencies, the number of outgoing dependencies is minimal, and the overall dependency count does not indicate hub-like behavior."
