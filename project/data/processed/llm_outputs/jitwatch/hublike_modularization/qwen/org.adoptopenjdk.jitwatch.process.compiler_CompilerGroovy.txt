    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerGroovy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (ILogListener) and one incoming dependency (LanguageManager). The number of dependencies is not excessive, and there is no evidence of hub-like modularization where the class would act as a central point with numerous incoming and outgoing connections to many other abstractions."
