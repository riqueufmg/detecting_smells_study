    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.zing.ZingLine",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ZingLine has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (6) and only one incoming dependency (from ZingLogParser). While it interacts with several other classes, the number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no indication of it acting as a central hub coordinating a large portion of the system. The dependencies are focused within the parsing and model components related to JIT watch functionality, suggesting a cohesive rather than hub-like role."
