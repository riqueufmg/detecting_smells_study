    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'JITWatchConfig' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and is referenced by 17 other classes through incoming dependencies. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'JITWatchConfig' acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
