    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to FileUtil and 1 incoming dependency from MainConfigStage. The incoming dependency from MainConfigStage includes 7 dependencies but this represents a single source of incoming dependencies, not multiple different abstractions depending on this class. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with excessive bidirectional dependencies."
