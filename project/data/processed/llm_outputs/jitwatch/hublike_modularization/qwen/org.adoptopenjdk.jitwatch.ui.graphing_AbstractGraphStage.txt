    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.AbstractGraphStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AbstractGraphStage' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes across multiple packages ('org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model'). This indicates that it interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
