    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.FileUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FileUtil has incoming dependencies from multiple classes across different packages, including ResourceLoader, Sandbox, and FileChooserListSrcZip. This indicates that FileUtil is being used by a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
