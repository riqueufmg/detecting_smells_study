    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.suggestion.SuggestionWalker",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class SuggestionWalker has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include ReportType, CodeCacheEvent, Report, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, ParseUtil, StringUtil, LogParseException, CompilationUtil, IParseDictionary, IMetaMember, and Tag. The incoming dependencies come from LaunchHeadless and JITWatchUI. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that SuggestionWalker acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
