    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'HotThrowFinder' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 other class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization."
