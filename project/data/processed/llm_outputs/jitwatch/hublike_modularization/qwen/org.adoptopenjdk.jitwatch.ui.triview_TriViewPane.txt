    "justification": "The class TriViewPane has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to Viewer, UserInterfaceUtil, and TriView. The incoming dependencies come only from TriView. This level of connectivity does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not show excessive or centralizing dependency relationships."
