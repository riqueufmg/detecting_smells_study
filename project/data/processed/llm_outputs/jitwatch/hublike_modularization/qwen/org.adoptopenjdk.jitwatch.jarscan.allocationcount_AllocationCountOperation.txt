{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount.AllocationCountOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to classes within the same package and one in a related bytecode model package. The incoming dependency is from a single class that manages multiple operations, which is a common pattern and does not indicate hub-like behavior. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not suggest hub-like modularization."
