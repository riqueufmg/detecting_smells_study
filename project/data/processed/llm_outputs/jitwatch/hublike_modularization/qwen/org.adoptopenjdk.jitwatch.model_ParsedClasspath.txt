    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 3 other classes, which is not excessively high. There are no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies involve usage in parser and configuration contexts, which is typical for model classes. The number and nature of dependencies do not indicate hub-like modularization."
