    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class AssemblyUtil has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (AssemblyParserARM, AssemblyParserX86, Architecture, IAssemblyParser) and incoming dependencies from 5 other abstractions (AssemblyProcessor, AssemblyLabels, AssemblyParserX86, AssemblyParserARM, ViewerAssembly). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as AssemblyUtil acts as a central point connecting multiple components in the system."
