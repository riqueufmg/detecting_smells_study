    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from JITWatchUI includes 34 dependencies, indicating a high number of incoming connections. The outgoing dependencies connect to IReadOnlyJITDataModel which itself has 7 dependencies, showing a broad outgoing connection pattern. This combination of numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
