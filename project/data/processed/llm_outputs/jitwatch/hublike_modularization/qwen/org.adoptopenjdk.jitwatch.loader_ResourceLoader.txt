{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.ResourceLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ResourceLoader class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (FileUtil and LanguageManager) and 3 incoming dependencies (RuntimeKotlin, EditorPane, TriView). While LanguageManager itself has many dependencies, the ResourceLoader only directly depends on it. The number of direct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) is not excessively high, and there is no evidence that ResourceLoader is a central hub connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
