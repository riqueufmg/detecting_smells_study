    "justification": "The class 'CompilationInfo' has only 2 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to 'UserInterfaceUtil' and 'Compilation', and the incoming dependency is from 'TriView'. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
