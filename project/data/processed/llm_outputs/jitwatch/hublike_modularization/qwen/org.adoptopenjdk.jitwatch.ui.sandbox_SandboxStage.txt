    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'SandboxStage' has outgoing dependencies to 17 other classes and 1 incoming dependency from 'JITWatchUI'. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with many different abstractions. Additionally, being referenced by a central class like 'JITWatchUI' which itself has numerous dependencies, suggests that 'SandboxStage' acts as a hub in the modularization structure."
