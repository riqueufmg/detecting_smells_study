    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly.ViewerAssembly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ViewerAssembly' has outgoing dependencies to 16 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('TriView'), which itself has a large number of dependencies. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that 'ViewerAssembly' interacts with many different abstractions, contributing to hub-like modularization. Additionally, being a central point of interaction in the UI module for assembly viewing increases its role as a hub."
