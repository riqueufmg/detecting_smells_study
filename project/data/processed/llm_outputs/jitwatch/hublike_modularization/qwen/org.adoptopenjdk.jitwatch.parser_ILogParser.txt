    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ILogParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ILogParser has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (SplitLog, ParsedClasspath, JITWatchConfig, JITDataModel, ILogParseErrorListener) and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes (LaunchHeadless, ParserFactory, Sandbox, SandboxStage, JITWatchUI). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that ILogParser acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
