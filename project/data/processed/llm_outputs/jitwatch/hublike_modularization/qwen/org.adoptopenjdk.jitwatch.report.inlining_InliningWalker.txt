    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.inlining.InliningWalker' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JITWatchUI'), which itself has a large number of dependencies (39). This indicates that 'InliningWalker' acts as a hub connecting a significant number of abstractions both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
