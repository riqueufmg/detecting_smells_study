{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'UserInterfaceUtil' has incoming dependencies from 34 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 classes. The high number of incoming dependencies (34) indicates that many other abstractions depend on it, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
