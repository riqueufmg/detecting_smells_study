    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.NothingMountedStage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'NothingMountedStage' has a limited number of dependencies. It depends on 4 classes directly and is depended upon by 1 class ('JITWatchUI'). The outgoing dependencies are to 'JITWatchConfig', 'JITWatchUI', 'StageManager', and 'UserInterfaceUtil', which is not an excessive number. The incoming dependency is from 'JITWatchUI', which itself has many dependencies, but this does not make 'NothingMountedStage' a hub. A hub class would typically have a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, acting as a central point of communication. In this case, 'NothingMountedStage' does not exhibit such characteristics."
