    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ClassSearch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ClassSearch class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4 classes) and only one incoming dependency from the TriView class. The dependencies are focused within the triview and model packages, and the class does not exhibit a hub-like pattern of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The TriView class appears to be the actual hub with significantly more dependencies."
