    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Task",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Task' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 10 other classes. The total number of dependencies (16) is significantly high, indicating that 'Task' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. This high degree of connectivity both incoming and outgoing confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
