    "justification": "The class IRuntime has incoming dependencies from multiple classes including LanguageManager and Sandbox, which depend on numerous other abstractions. Additionally, IRuntime has outgoing dependencies to ILogListener. The combination of multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies with various abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
