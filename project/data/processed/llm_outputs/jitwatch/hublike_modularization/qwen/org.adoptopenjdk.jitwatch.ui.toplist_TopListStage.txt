    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TopListStage' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JITWatchUI') which itself has a large number of dependencies (35). This indicates that 'TopListStage' acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system, both in terms of outgoing and incoming dependency traffic, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
