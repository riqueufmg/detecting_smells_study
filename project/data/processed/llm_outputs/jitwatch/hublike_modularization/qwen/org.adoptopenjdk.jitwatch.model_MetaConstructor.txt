{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from JITDataModel shows 14 dependencies but these are not directly to MetaConstructor. The outgoing dependencies are limited and do not indicate hub-like behavior where this class would be central to a large number of other abstractions."
