    "justification": "The class AbstractAssemblyParser has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes, but there are no incoming dependencies from other classes. Hub-like Modularization requires significant incoming and outgoing dependencies, indicating the class is both a hub and a bottleneck. Since there are no incoming dependencies, it does not qualify as a hub-like module."
