    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The ConstantPool class has only one incoming dependency from ClassBC and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependency from ClassBC shows a limited scope of usage with only 5 dependencies total, which does not indicate hub-like modularization. There is no evidence of extensive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize this as a hub-like abstraction."
