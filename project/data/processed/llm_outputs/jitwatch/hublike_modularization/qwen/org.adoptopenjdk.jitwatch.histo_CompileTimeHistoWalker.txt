    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IReadOnlyJITDataModel and IMetaMember) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies, but the CompileTimeHistoWalker class in isolation does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not directly depend on a large number of other abstractions."
