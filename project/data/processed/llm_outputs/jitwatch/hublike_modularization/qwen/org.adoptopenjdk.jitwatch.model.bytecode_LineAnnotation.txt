    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.LineAnnotation",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 1 other class (BCAnnotationType) and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes (BytecodeAnnotations, BytecodeAnnotationList, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, OptimisedLocksWalker, EliminatedAllocationWalker, AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, InliningWalker). This high number of incoming dependencies (7) indicates that many other abstractions depend on this class, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
