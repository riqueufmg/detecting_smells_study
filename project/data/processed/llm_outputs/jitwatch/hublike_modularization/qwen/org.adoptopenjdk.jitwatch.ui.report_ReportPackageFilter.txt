    "justification": "The class ReportPackageFilter has only one outgoing dependency to ReportStage and one incoming dependency from ReportStage. The dependencies listed under ReportStage involve other classes, but ReportPackageFilter itself does not directly depend on or influence those classes. The number of direct dependencies is limited and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
