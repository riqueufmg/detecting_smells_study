    "justification": "The class has 1 outgoing dependency and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from JITWatchUI includes 54 dependencies, indicating a large number of interactions. The outgoing dependency to UserInterfaceUtil includes 2 dependencies. The combination of these incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
