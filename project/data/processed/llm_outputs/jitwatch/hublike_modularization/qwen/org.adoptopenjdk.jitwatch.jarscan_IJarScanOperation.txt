    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.IJarScanOperation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to MemberBytecode) and 1 incoming dependency (from JarScan). The number of dependencies is not excessively large, and there is no evidence of hub-like modularization where the class acts as a central hub connecting to many other abstractions."
