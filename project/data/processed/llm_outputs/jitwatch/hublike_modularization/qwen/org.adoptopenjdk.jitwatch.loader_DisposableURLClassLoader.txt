{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.DisposableURLClassLoader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies from different classes (ClassUtil and ReflectionJavap) and no outgoing dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions."
