    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.OSUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class OSUtil has incoming dependencies from 1 classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 classes. The incoming dependencies include JITWatchUI which itself depends on a large number of other classes, indicating that OSUtil acts as a hub connecting multiple parts of the system. Additionally, OSUtil has outgoing dependencies to Architecture and its inner class OperatingSystem, showing it connects to multiple abstractions both internally and externally. This pattern of having multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies classifies it as Hub-like Modularization."
