    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.Viewer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Viewer class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include classes from different packages such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model, and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main. The incoming dependencies come from classes in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview packages. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates Hub-like Modularization."
