    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount.InstructionAllocCountMap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Opcode and AllocCountMap) and 1 incoming dependency (AllocationCountOperation). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
