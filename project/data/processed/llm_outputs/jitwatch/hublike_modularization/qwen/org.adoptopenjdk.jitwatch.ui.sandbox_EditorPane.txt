    "justification": "The EditorPane class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and incoming dependencies (2). The dependencies are focused on specific functionality related to sandbox UI operations and do not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions. The class does not exhibit excessive coupling or serve as a central coordinator with many unrelated components."
