    "justification": "The class 'BytecodeAnnotationBuilder' has outgoing dependencies to 22 other classes and incoming dependencies from 3 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
