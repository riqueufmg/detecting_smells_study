    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TreeVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes: 'IReadOnlyJITDataModel', 'ITreeVisitable', and 'MetaPackage'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 5 different classes across multiple packages ('AbstractTopListVisitable', 'LaunchHeadless', 'AbstractHistoVisitable', 'AbstractReportBuilder', 'AbstractCompilationWalker'). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
