    "justification": "The class 'ReportStage' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The outgoing dependencies include classes from multiple packages such as 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core', and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining'. Additionally, the class 'JITWatchUI' in the incoming dependencies has a large number of dependencies, indicating that 'ReportStage' is involved in numerous interactions, which suggests hub-like modularization."
