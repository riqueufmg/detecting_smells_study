    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to IReadOnlyJITDataModel and IMetaMember, which themselves have multiple dependencies, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class. The class does not show excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies that would characterize hub-like modularization."
