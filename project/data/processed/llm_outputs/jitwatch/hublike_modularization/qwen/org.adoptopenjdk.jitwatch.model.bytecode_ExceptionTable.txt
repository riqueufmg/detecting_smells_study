{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.ExceptionTable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'ExceptionTable' has incoming dependencies from 3 other classes ('MemberBytecode', 'BytecodeAnnotationBuilder', 'HotThrowFinder') and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('ExceptionTableEntry'). The incoming dependencies include multiple classes from both the same package and a different package, indicating that this class is used by a variety of other abstractions. Additionally, it is involved in dependencies with several other classes within its own package, suggesting it interacts with a large number of abstractions both in terms of usage by other classes and its own dependencies."
