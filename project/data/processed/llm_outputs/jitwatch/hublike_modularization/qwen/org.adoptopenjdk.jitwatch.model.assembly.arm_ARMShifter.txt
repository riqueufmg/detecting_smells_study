    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm.ARMShifter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ARMShifter has only one incoming dependency from ViewerAssembly, which contains 16 dependencies in total. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing dependencies with other abstractions. The incoming dependency list shows ViewerAssembly depends on multiple classes including ARMShifter, but this does not indicate hub-like behavior for ARMShifter itself."
