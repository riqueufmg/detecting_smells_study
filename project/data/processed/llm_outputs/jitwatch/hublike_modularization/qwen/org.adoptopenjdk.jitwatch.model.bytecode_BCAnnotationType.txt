{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCAnnotationType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has incoming dependencies from 7 different classes across multiple packages, indicating it is used by a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has no outgoing dependencies, suggesting it acts as a central point that other classes depend on without itself depending on many others, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
