    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.HeadlessUtil",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to classes in the same package (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model) and the incoming dependency is from a single class in another package. This does not indicate a large number of dependencies which would be characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
