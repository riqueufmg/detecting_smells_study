    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.ICompiler",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class ICompiler has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (LanguageManager and Sandbox) which depend on a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, ICompiler has outgoing dependencies to ILogListener. The combination of multiple incoming dependencies from classes that themselves have many dependencies, along with outgoing dependencies, indicates hub-like modularization where ICompiler acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
