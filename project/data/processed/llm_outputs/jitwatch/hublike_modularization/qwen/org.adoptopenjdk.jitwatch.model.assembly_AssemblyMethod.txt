    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyMethod",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AssemblyMethod' has incoming dependencies from 8 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many abstractions depend on this class, making it a central hub in the modularization structure. Additionally, it maintains outgoing dependencies to multiple abstractions, further reinforcing its role as a hub."
