    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MetaClass' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 20 other abstractions. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MetaClass' acts as a hub within the system, connecting to numerous other components, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
