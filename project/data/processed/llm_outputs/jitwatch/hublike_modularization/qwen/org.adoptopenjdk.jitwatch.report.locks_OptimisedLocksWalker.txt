    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.locks.OptimisedLocksWalker' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies. It has incoming dependencies from 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI', which itself depends on a large number of other classes (35 total), indicating that OptimisedLocksWalker is a central point of interaction. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to multiple core model classes such as 'IReadOnlyJITDataModel' which further connects to 7 other model classes, 'LineAnnotation', and 'BCAnnotationType'. This pattern of being both a major dependency consumer and provider creates a hub-like structure where this class acts as a central coordinator with many connections."
