    "justification": "The class ISandboxStage has only 2 outgoing dependencies (EditorPane and IMetaMember) and 2 incoming dependencies (Sandbox and EditorPane). The number of dependencies is relatively low, and there is no evidence of excessive incoming or outgoing connections that would indicate hub-like modularization."
