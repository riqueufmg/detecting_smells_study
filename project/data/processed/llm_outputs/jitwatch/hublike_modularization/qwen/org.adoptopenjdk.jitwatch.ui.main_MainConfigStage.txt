    "justification": "The class 'MainConfigStage' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JITWatchUI') which itself has dependencies to 50+ classes. This indicates that 'MainConfigStage' is a central point connecting to numerous abstractions both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
