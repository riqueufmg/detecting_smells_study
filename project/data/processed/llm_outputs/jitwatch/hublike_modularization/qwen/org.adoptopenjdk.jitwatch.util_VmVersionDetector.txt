    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.VmVersionDetector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (StringUtil and Tag) and 1 incoming dependency (HotSpotLogParser). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
