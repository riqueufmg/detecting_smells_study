    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The outgoing dependencies are to Report, IMetaMember, and IStageAccessProxy. The incoming dependency is from ReportStage. This is not a large number of dependencies, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
