    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'TimeLineStage' has outgoing dependencies to 8 different classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JITWatchUI'), which itself has a large number of outgoing dependencies. This indicates that 'TimeLineStage' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
