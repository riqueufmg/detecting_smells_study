    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs' has incoming dependencies from 5 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes, creating a hub-like dependency structure. The high number of incoming dependencies indicates that many classes rely on this class, while the outgoing dependencies show it also connects to multiple other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
