    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser.FileChooserList",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class FileChooserList has only one outgoing dependency to UserInterfaceUtil and is referenced by two other classes (SandboxConfigStage and MainConfigStage). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
