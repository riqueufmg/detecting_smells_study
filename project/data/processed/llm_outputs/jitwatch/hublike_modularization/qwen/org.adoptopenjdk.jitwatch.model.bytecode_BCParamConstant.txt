    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class BCParamConstant has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from BytecodeLoader, which depends on 18 different classes including BCParamConstant. While BytecodeLoader is hub-like, BCParamConstant itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
