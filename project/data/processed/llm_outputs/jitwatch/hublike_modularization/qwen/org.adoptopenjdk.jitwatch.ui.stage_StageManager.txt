    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'StageManager' has incoming dependencies from 5 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 4 different classes. The incoming dependencies include classes from different packages such as 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox' and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main'. The outgoing dependencies also span multiple packages including 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main', 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model', and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util'. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization."
