    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode' has incoming dependencies from 21 other classes across multiple packages, indicating a high number of abstractions depending on it. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies listed as empty, but given its central role implied by the incoming dependencies, it likely interacts with many other abstractions directly or indirectly. This pattern of having numerous incoming dependencies from various parts of the system suggests hub-like modularization where this class acts as a central point of interaction."
