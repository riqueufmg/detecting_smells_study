    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.NativeMethodSizeTopListVisitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IReadOnlyJITDataModel and IMetaMember) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
