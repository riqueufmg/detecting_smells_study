    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its parent class JITWatchConfig, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization. Hub-like modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, but this class shows minimal dependency relationships."
