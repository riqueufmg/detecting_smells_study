    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotationList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'BytecodeAnnotationList' has incoming dependencies from 4 other classes ('BytecodeAnnotations', 'AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker', 'InliningWalker', 'ViewerBytecode') and outgoing dependencies to 1 class ('LineAnnotation'). This creates a hub-like structure where this class acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions, both in terms of incoming and outgoing relationships."
