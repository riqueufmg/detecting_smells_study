    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IMetaMember' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its extensive incoming and outgoing dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes and receives incoming dependencies from a large number of classes across various packages (e.g., toplist, treevisitor, histo, parser, util, model, assembly, bytecode, report, intrinsic, compilation, hotthrow, inline, chain, sandbox, ui). This central role with numerous bidirectional relationships indicates it acts as a hub within the system architecture."
