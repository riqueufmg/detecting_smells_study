    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITDataModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JITDataModel has outgoing dependencies to 15 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 classes. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that JITDataModel interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, the incoming dependencies show that external classes rely on JITDataModel, further supporting its role as a hub in the system."
