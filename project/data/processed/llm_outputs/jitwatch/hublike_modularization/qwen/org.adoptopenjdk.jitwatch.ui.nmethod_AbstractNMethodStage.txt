    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'AbstractNMethodStage' has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes across multiple packages, including 'RateLimitedResizeListener', 'UserInterfaceUtil', 'Compilation', 'JITWatchUI', 'NMethodInfo', and 'IMetaMember'. Among these, 'JITWatchUI' itself has a large number of outgoing dependencies (35), indicating it is a hub-like component. Additionally, 'AbstractNMethodStage' interacts with core model and UI components, suggesting it plays a central role in coordinating between different modules. The class exhibits both incoming and outgoing dependencies with a wide range of abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
