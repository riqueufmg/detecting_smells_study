    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.SourceMapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The SourceMapper class has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (3). The outgoing dependencies are ClassBC, MemberBytecode, and LineTable. The incoming dependencies come from BytecodeLoader, JITDataModel, and TriView. While it interacts with multiple classes, the number of dependencies is not excessively high to qualify as hub-like modularization. The dependencies are focused within the bytecode model and related UI components, indicating a cohesive responsibility rather than being a central hub with widespread system-level dependencies."
