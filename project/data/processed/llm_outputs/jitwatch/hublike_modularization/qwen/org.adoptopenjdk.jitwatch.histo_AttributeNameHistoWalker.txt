    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo.AttributeNameHistoWalker",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (IReadOnlyJITDataModel and IMetaMember) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies themselves have multiple dependencies but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for the analyzed class since it only directly depends on 2 abstractions."
