    "justification": "The class 'SplitLog' has incoming dependencies from 'AbstractLogParser' which depends on 17 different classes, and 'ILogParser' which depends on 5 different classes. Additionally, 'SplitLog' has an outgoing dependency to 'NumberedLine'. This pattern of multiple incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
