    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JarScan has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes, which is a high number indicating hub-like behavior. It depends on multiple operation classes (InstructionCountOperation, SequenceCountOperation, FreqInlineSizeOperation, AllocationCountOperation, NextInstructionOperation, MethodLengthOperation, InvokeCountOperation, MethodSizeHistoOperation, SequenceSearchOperation), as well as BytecodeLoader and ClassBC. This centralizes coordination and creates a hub-like modularization smell."
