{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.CompilationTableRow",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 outgoing dependencies and 1 incoming dependency. The incoming dependency from JITWatchUI shows that one class depends on it, but this is not excessive. The outgoing dependencies are limited to a small number of classes in different packages. This does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have numerous incoming and outgoing dependencies making it a central hub."
