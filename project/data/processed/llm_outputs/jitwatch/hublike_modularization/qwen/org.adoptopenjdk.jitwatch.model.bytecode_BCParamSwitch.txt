    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BCParamSwitch",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies are from two classes: 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader.BytecodeLoader' which lists 18 dependencies including this class, and 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction' which lists 4 dependencies including this class. Since there are no outgoing dependencies and the number of incoming dependencies is relatively low, it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
