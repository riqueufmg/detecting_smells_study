    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.IAssemblyParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class IAssemblyParser has incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (AssemblyProcessor, AssemblyUtil, ViewerAssembly) and outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes (AssemblyInstruction, AssemblyMethod, Architecture, AssemblyLabels). This creates a hub-like structure where IAssemblyParser acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, satisfying the criteria for Hub-like Modularization smell."
