{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.comparator.MemberComparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to Report class and 0 incoming dependencies. The Report class itself has 2 dependencies (ReportType and IMetaMember) but these are not direct dependencies of MemberComparator. The total dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
