    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaPackage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MetaPackage' has incoming dependencies from 7 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MetaPackage' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
