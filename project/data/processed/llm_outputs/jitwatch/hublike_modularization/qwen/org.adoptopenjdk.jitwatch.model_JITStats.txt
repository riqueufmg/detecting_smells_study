{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.JITStats",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JITStats has incoming dependencies from multiple classes (IReadOnlyJITDataModel, JITDataModel, StatsStage, TimeLineStage) and is referenced in their dependency lists, indicating it is used by a large number of other abstractions. Additionally, it has no outgoing dependencies, which aligns with the hub-like modularization smell where a class acts as a central point with many incoming references but few or no outgoing ones."
