    "justification": "The class 'CompilationUtil' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 11 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'CompilationUtil' acts as a hub, connecting multiple parts of the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
