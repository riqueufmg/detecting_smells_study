    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeAnnotations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'BytecodeAnnotations' has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes: 'LineAnnotation', 'IMetaMember', and 'BytecodeAnnotationList'. It also has incoming dependencies from 5 classes: 'MemberBytecode', 'BytecodeAnnotationBuilder', 'AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker', 'InliningWalker', and 'ViewerBytecode'. This results in a total of 8 distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing), indicating a high level of coupling with other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
