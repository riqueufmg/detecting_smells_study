    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks.OptimisedLockRowBean",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies are to ReportType, Report, and Compilation classes. While the Compilation class has several dependencies, the OptimisedLockRowBean itself does not directly depend on those classes. The number of direct dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
