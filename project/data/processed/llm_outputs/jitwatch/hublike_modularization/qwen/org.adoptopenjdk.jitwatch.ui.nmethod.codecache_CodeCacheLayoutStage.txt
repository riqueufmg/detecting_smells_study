    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache.CodeCacheLayoutStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CodeCacheLayoutStage' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class ('JITWatchUI'), which itself has a large number of outgoing dependencies. The class interacts with multiple abstractions across different packages, indicating a central role in the module. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies suggests hub-like behavior."
