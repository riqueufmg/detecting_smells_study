    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer.JournalViewerStage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class JournalViewerStage has outgoing dependencies to 3 classes and incoming dependencies from 1 class (JITWatchUI). The outgoing dependencies from JITWatchUI alone include 30+ classes, indicating that JITWatchUI is a hub. Since JournalViewerStage depends on this hub class, and given the high number of transitive dependencies involved, it participates in hub-like modularization. Additionally, JournalViewerStage is listed within JITWatchUI's own dependencies, suggesting mutual or reflective coupling, which reinforces the hub-like structure."
