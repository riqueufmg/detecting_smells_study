    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class LanguageManager has outgoing dependencies to 16 other classes and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that LanguageManager acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
