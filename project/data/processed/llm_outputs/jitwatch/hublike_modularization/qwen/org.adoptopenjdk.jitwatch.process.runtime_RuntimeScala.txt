    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (ILogListener) and appears in the dependencies of one incoming class (LanguageManager). The number of dependencies is not excessive for the scope provided, and there is no evidence of hub-like behavior with a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies."
