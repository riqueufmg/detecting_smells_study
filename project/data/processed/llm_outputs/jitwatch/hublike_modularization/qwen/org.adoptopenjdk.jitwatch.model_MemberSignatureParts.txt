    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'MemberSignatureParts' has outgoing dependencies to 4 other classes and incoming dependencies from 18 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'MemberSignatureParts' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
