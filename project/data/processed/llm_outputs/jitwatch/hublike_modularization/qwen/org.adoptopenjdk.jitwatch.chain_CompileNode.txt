{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain.CompileNode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'CompileNode' has outgoing dependencies to 5 distinct classes: 'Compilation', 'IReadOnlyJITDataModel', 'ParseUtil', 'IParseDictionary', and 'IMetaMember'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 distinct classes: 'CompileChainWalker' and 'CompileChainStage'. This results in a total of 7 distinct dependencies (both incoming and outgoing), which indicates a high level of coupling and qualifies as Hub-like Modularization."
