{
    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.PackageManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class PackageManager has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes (MetaPackage, MetaClass) and incoming dependencies from 7 classes (ParseUtil, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, JITDataModel, AssemblyProcessor, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, ClassSearch, JITWatchUI). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting multiple other abstractions in the system."
