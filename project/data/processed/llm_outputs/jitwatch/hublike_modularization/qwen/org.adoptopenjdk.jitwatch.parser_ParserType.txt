    "justification": "The class 'org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.ParserType' has incoming dependencies from 5 different classes but no outgoing dependencies. While it is referenced by multiple classes, the number of incoming dependencies (5) does not indicate a large number relative to the context size of 1458, and it does not exhibit both incoming and outgoing dependencies which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
