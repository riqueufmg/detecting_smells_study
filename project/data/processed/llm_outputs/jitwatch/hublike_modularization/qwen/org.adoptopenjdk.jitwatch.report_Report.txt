    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Report' has outgoing dependencies to 2 classes ('ReportType', 'IMetaMember') and incoming dependencies from 13 different classes across multiple packages. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as the class acts as a central point connecting numerous other abstractions."
