    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (IRedrawable) and three incoming dependencies (AbstractNMethodStage, AbstractGraphStage, CompileChainStage). The total number of distinct dependency connections (incoming + outgoing) is 4, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies indicative of Hub-like Modularization."
