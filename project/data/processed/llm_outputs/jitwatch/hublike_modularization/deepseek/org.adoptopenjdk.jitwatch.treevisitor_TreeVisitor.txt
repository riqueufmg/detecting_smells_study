    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (ITreeVisitable, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, MetaPackage) and is used by 5 incoming dependencies (AbstractTopListVisitable, LaunchHeadless, AbstractHistoVisitable, AbstractReportBuilder, AbstractCompilationWalker). This total of 8 distinct dependency connections does not constitute a large number that would indicate Hub-like Modularization."
