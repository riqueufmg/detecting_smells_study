    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies (MetaClass, MemberSignatureParts, AssemblyMethod, MemberBytecode, Compilation) and 45 incoming dependencies from distinct classes across multiple packages (toplist, treevisitor, histo, parser, util, model, assembly, bytecode, report, intrinsic, compilation, hotthrow, inline, chain, sandbox, ui). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a central hub."
