    "justification": "The class has zero outgoing dependencies and only two incoming dependencies (from BytecodeLoader and BytecodeInstruction). This low number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, which is required for Hub-like Modularization."
