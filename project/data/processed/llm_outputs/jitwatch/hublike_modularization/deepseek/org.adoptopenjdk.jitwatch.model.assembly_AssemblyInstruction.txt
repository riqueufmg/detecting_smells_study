    "class": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyInstruction",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions (AssemblyLabels, StringUtil) and incoming dependencies from 8 other abstractions (IAssemblyParser, AssemblyBlock, AssemblyLabels, AbstractAssemblyParser, AssemblyParserX86, AssemblyParserARM, AssemblyLabel, ViewerAssembly). This results in a total of 10 distinct dependency relationships, indicating a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections, which characterizes Hub-like Modularization."
