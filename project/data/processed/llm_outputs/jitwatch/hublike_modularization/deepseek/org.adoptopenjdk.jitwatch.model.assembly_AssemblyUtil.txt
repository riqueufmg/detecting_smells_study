    "justification": "AssemblyUtil has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (AssemblyParserARM, IAssemblyParser, AssemblyParserX86, Architecture) and incoming dependencies from 5 other abstractions (AssemblyProcessor, AssemblyLabels, AssemblyParserX86, AssemblyParserARM, ViewerAssembly). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates a hub-like coupling pattern."
