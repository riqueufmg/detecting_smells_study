    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies (IMetaMember, LineAnnotation, BytecodeAnnotationList) and 5 incoming dependencies (MemberBytecode, BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode). This total of 8 distinct dependencies is not considered a large number for hub-like modularization."
