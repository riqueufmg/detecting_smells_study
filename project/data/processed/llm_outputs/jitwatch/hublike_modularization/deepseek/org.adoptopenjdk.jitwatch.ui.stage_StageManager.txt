    "justification": "StageManager has 4 outgoing dependencies and is depended upon by 5 incoming dependencies (SandboxStage, VMLanguageList, NothingMountedStage, MainConfigStage, JITWatchUI), resulting in a total of 9 distinct dependency relationships. This high number of both incoming and outgoing connections indicates it acts as a central hub."
