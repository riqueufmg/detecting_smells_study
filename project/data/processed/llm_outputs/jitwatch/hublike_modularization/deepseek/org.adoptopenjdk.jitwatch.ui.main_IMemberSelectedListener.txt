    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (IMetaMember) and five incoming dependencies (TopListStage, TriView, ClassMemberList, CompilationChooser, CompileChainStage). This does not constitute a large number of dependencies in both directions to indicate a hub-like modularization."
