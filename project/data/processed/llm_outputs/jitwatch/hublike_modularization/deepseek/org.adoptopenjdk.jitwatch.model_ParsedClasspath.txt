    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has zero outgoing dependencies and only three incoming dependencies (from AbstractLogParser, ILogParser, and JITWatchConfig). This low number of dependencies does not meet the threshold for a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
