    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (LineTableEntry, MemberBytecode) and 3 incoming dependencies (SourceMapper, MemberBytecode, TriView, ViewerBytecode). The total number of distinct dependency connections is low, not indicating a hub-like pattern with a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
