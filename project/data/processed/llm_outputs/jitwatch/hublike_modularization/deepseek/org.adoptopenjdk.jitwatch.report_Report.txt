    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 abstractions (ReportType, IMetaMember) and incoming dependencies from 12 other abstractions (AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker, MemberComparator, ScoreComparator, SuggestionWalker, InliningWalker, ViewerBytecode, EliminatedAllocationRowBean, AbstractReportRowBean, OptimisedLockRowBean, SuggestionRowBean, InliningRowBean, LinkedBCICell, MemberTableCell). This large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
