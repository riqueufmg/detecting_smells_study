    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 12 distinct abstractions (SequenceCountOperation, InstructionCountOperation, AllocationCountOperation, SequenceSearchOperation, BytecodeLoader, InvokeCountOperation, MethodLengthOperation, IJarScanOperation, ClassBC, MethodSizeHistoOperation, FreqInlineSizeOperation, NextInstructionOperation), which constitutes a large number of outgoing dependencies, indicating hub-like modularization."
