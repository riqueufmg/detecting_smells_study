    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 12 distinct abstractions (IReadOnlyJITDataModel, ILogParser, HeadlessUtil, JITEvent, ParserType, JITWatchConfig, TreeVisitor, ScoreComparator, StringUtil, HeadlessInlineVisitor, SuggestionWalker, ParserFactory). This large number of outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub, coordinating many other components."
