Contains multiple nested types (Request, Response, KeyVal, Base) and many dependencies across parsing, authentication, cookie and data utilities. Concentrates networking, request building, response handling, authentication and parsing logic — responsibilities that would be better split into smaller, focused classes."

Depends on parsing, stream handling, document and entity classes and HttpConnection.Response. Performs I/O, charset detection, parsing and document construction — multiple concerns that suggest it should be decomposed (I/O/stream utilities, charset detection, document conversion)."

The class appears to centralize a wide range of validation and helper logic rather than small focused validators, indicating insufficient modularization."

Handles construction and traversal/translation to W3C DOM which mixes traversal, building and formatting logic — a candidate for splitting builder, traversal and conversion responsibilities."
