    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions (CharacterReader.CharPredicate, TokeniserState, SoftPool, Validate, StringUtil) and incoming dependencies from 7 other abstractions (Entities, CookieUtil, Tokeniser, TokeniserState, TreeBuilder, TokenQueue, ParseError). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
