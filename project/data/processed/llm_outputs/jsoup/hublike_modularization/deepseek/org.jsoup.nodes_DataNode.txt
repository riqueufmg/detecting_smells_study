    "justification": "The analyzed class DataNode has only 2 outgoing dependencies (QuietAppendable, Document) and 3 incoming dependencies (Element, HtmlTreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder). This small number of dependencies does not indicate a hub-like modularization, which requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies."
