    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 2 other abstractions (org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer, org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes) and incoming dependencies from 12 other abstractions (Attributes, Element, Document, Node, Evaluator, Evaluator.MatchText, Parser, HtmlTreeBuilderState, TreeBuilder, Tag, HtmlTreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder, TagSet). The total number of distinct dependent abstractions (both incoming and outgoing) is 14, which is a large number, indicating a hub-like structure."
