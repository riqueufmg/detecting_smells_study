    "justification": "The class has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (Token, DocumentType, Tokeniser, CharacterReader) and incoming dependencies from 8 other abstractions (Tokeniser, Token, Token.Tag, Token.Character, CharacterReader, HtmlTreeBuilderState, Tag, HtmlTreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder). This large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates it acts as a hub."
