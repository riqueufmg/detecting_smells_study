{
    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.internal.Normalizer' has incoming dependencies from 8 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 different classes. The high number of incoming dependencies (8) indicates that many abstractions rely on this class, and the outgoing dependencies (2) show it interacts with multiple other abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
