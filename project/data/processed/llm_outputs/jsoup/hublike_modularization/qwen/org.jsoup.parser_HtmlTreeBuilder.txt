    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class HtmlTreeBuilder has outgoing dependencies to 18 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a central hub, coordinating interactions between multiple other classes, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
