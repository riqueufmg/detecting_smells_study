    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.StartTag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class Token, which is expected for inner classes. The incoming dependencies list shows Token has dependencies on many classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization for Token.StartTag itself."
