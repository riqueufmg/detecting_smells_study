    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.Matches",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.jsoup.helper.Regex and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency count is low and does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
