    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Printer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'Printer' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes: Tag, StringUtil, NodeUtils, Node, Element, QuietAppendable, TextNode, LeafNode, and Entities. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 2 other classes: Element and Node. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Printer' acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
