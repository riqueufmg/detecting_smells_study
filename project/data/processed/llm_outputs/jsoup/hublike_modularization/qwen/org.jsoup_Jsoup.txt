    "class": "org.jsoup.Jsoup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class Jsoup has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes (HttpConnection, Safelist, Document, Cleaner, DataUtil, Parser, Connection) and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes (ListLinks, HtmlToPlainText, Wikipedia, Document, FormElement). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that Jsoup acts as a central hub connecting various parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
