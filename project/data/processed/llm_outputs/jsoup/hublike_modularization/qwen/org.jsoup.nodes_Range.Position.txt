```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Range.Position",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from the Range class within the same package. The incoming dependency shows Range depends on Position along with other classes in the same package, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
