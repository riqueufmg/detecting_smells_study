    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection' has a high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. It depends on 11 other classes directly (outgoing dependencies), and is depended upon by 7 other classes (incoming dependencies). This extensive interconnection with multiple abstractions indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
