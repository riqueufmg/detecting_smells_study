    "class": "org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator.Has",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool and 0 incoming dependencies. The low number of dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) does not indicate hub-like modularization, as there are no extensive connections to a large number of other abstractions."
