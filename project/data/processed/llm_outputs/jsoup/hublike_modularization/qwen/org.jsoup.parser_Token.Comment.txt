```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.Comment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (TokenData) and 1 incoming dependency (Token). While Token has multiple dependencies, the Token.Comment class itself only has a single incoming and single outgoing dependency, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies indicative of hub-like modularization."
