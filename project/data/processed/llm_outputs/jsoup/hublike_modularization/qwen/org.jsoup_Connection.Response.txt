```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection.Response",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only incoming dependencies from one other class (Connection) and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies consist of 8 different types/classes, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization where a class would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing."
