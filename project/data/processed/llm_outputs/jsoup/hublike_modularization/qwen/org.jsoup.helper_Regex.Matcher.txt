{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.Regex.Matcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from org.jsoup.helper.Regex. The incoming dependency shows Regex depends on Matcher along with two other classes (SharedConstants and Re2jRegex), but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
