{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.ParseError",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class ParseError has only 1 outgoing dependency to CharacterReader and no incoming dependencies. The dependency analysis shows limited coupling, which does not indicate hub-like modularization where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
