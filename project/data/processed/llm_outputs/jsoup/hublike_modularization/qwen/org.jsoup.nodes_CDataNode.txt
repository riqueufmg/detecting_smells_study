{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.CDataNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class CDataNode has only 2 outgoing dependencies (QuietAppendable and Document) and 3 incoming dependencies (Element, HtmlTreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder). The Document class has many dependencies, but that is not a characteristic of CDataNode itself. The number of dependencies of CDataNode is relatively small and does not indicate hub-like modularization."
