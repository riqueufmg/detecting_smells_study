    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpClientExecutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class HttpClientExecutor has only 3 outgoing dependencies (HttpConnection, Connection, RequestAuthenticator) and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. None of the dependencies show excessive coupling or centralization that would characterize a hub."
