    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 1 other class. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates that this class interacts with a large number of other abstractions, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
