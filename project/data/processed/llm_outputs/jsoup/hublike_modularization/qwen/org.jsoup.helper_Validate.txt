```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.Validate",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.helper.Validate' has incoming dependencies from 35 different classes across multiple packages including 'org.jsoup.examples', 'org.jsoup.internal', 'org.jsoup.safety', 'org.jsoup.nodes', 'org.jsoup.helper', 'org.jsoup.select', and 'org.jsoup.parser'. This indicates that a large number of other abstractions depend on it, which aligns with the characteristics of Hub-like Modularization where an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
