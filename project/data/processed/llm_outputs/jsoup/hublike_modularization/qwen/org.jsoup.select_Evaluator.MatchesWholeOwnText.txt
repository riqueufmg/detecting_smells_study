    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (org.jsoup.helper.Regex) and 0 incoming dependencies, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies in either direction. Hub-like Modularization requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions, which is not present in this case."
