{
    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes ('org.jsoup.internal.SoftPool', 'org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil.StringJoiner', 'org.jsoup.helper.Validate') and incoming dependencies from 23 other classes across multiple packages. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'StringUtil' acts as a hub, being widely used and also depending on several other abstractions, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
