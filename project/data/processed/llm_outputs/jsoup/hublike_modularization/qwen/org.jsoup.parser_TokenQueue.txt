    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue' has incoming dependencies from 3 other classes (Element, Selector, QueryParser) and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes (CharacterReader, Validate, StringUtil). This creates a hub-like structure where TokenQueue acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions both in terms of incoming and outgoing dependencies, satisfying the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
