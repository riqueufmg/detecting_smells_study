    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Entities",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.nodes.Entities' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 11 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
