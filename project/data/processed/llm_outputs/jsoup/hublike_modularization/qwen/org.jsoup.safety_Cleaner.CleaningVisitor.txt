    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner.CleaningVisitor' has outgoing dependencies to 26 different classes in the 'org.jsoup.nodes' package and incoming dependencies from 'org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner', indicating it acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies across different packages confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
