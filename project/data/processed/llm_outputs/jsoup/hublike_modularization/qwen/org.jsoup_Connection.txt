    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.Connection' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from 13 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by many other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
