    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Printer.Pretty",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Tag and Entities) and no incoming dependencies. While the dependent classes have their own dependencies, the Printer.Pretty class itself does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions directly."
