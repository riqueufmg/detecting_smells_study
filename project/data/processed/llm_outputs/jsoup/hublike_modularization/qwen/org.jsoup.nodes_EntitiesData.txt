    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.EntitiesData",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class EntitiesData has only 2 incoming dependencies (from Entities and Entities.EscapeMode) and no outgoing dependencies. The incoming dependencies are limited to only 2 other abstractions, which does not constitute a large number of dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
