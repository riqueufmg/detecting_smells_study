```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.Protocol",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from Safelist class. The incoming dependency list shows Safelist depends on 9 classes including Safelist.Protocol, but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship, not multiple dependencies from different abstractions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependency connections."
