{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Evaluator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.select.Evaluator' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (Node, Regex, Element, LeafNode, ParseSettings) and incoming dependencies from 10 other classes (Element, Document, FormElement, DataUtil, Elements, Selector, Collector, StructuralEvaluator, QueryParser, StreamParser). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
