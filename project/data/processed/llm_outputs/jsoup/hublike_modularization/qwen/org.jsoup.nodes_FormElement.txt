    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class FormElement has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that FormElement acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions."
