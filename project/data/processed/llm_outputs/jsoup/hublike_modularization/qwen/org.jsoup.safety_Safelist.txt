    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.safety.Safelist' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 2 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that this class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions in the system."
