    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner.ElementMeta",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner.ElementMeta' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of outgoing dependencies (26) to various abstractions in the 'org.jsoup.nodes' package and others, combined with incoming dependencies from 'org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner' which also involves multiple abstractions. This central role in managing dependencies between a large number of other classes indicates hub-like behavior."
