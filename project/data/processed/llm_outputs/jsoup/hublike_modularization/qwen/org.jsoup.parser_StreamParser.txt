    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.parser.StreamParser' has outgoing dependencies to 8 other classes and incoming dependencies from at least 1 class ('org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil'). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions across different packages."
