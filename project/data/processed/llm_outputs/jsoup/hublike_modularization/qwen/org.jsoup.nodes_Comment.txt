{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Comment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'Comment' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (4) and incoming dependencies (4). The outgoing dependencies are to 'Document', 'QuietAppendable', 'Parser', and 'XmlDeclaration'. The incoming dependencies come from 'Element', 'DataUtil', 'HtmlTreeBuilder', and 'XmlTreeBuilder'. This level of dependency interaction does not indicate hub-like modularization, as it does not exhibit excessive or centralizing dependency relationships with a large number of abstractions."
