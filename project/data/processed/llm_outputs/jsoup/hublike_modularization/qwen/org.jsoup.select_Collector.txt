{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Collector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.select.Collector' has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes (Elements, Element, Nodes, Evaluator) and incoming dependencies from 2 classes (Element, Selector). The dependency counts are high relative to the context size of 1039, indicating it interacts with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing, which aligns with the Hub-like Modularization smell."
