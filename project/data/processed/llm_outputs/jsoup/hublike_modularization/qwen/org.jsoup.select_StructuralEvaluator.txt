    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator' has a limited number of outgoing dependencies (5) and only one incoming dependency from 'org.jsoup.select.QueryParser'. The number of dependencies is not excessively high, and there is no evidence of it acting as a hub with numerous incoming and outgoing connections to a large number of other abstractions."
