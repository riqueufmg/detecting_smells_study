    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.nodes.Node' has outgoing dependencies to 12 other classes and incoming dependencies from 19 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Node' acts as a central hub connecting numerous abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
