    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (SoftPool and Validate) and 1 incoming dependency (ControllableInputStream). This limited number of dependencies does not constitute a hub-like modularization pattern where an abstraction would have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
