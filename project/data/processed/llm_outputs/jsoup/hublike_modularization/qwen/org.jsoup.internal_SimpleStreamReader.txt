```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.SimpleStreamReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (to org.jsoup.helper.Validate) and 1 incoming dependency (from org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil). The incoming dependency from DataUtil shows it depends on 12 classes, but this represents DataUtil's dependencies, not SimpleStreamReader's. SimpleStreamReader itself only has direct dependencies with 2 other abstractions, which is not indicative of hub-like modularization."
