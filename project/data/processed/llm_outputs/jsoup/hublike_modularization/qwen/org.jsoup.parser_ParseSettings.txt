{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings' has incoming dependencies from 13 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 2 other classes, making a total of 15 dependencies. This high number of dependencies indicates that 'ParseSettings' acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of other abstractions both in terms of being used by many classes and using several others, which aligns with the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
