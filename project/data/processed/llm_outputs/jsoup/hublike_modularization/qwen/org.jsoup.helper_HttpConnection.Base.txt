    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.jsoup.Connection and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency has 8 sub-dependencies, but this is not sufficient to qualify as hub-like modularization since the class itself only connects to one other class."
