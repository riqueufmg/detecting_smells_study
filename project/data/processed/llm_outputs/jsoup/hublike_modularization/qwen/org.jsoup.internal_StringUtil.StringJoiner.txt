    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil.StringJoiner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class StringUtil. The incoming dependency list shows only one class (StringUtil) depending on it, along with two other classes (SoftPool and Validate) that are dependencies of StringUtil, not StringJoiner. This limited dependency pattern does not indicate hub-like modularization."
