    "justification": "The class ListLinks has only 4 outgoing dependencies and no incoming dependencies. The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization. None of the dependencies show excessive coupling or centralization patterns that would suggest this class acts as a hub in the system."
