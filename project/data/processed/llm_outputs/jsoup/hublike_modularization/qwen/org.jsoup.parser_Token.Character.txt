    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of outgoing dependencies (3) and incoming dependencies (1). The outgoing dependencies are to TokenData, TokeniserState, and Tokeniser. The incoming dependency is from Token. None of these dependencies indicate a large number of interactions. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
