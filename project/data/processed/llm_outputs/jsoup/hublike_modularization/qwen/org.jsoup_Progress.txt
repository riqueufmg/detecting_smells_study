{
    "class": "org.jsoup.Progress",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.Progress' has incoming dependencies from 4 other classes ('org.jsoup.Connection', 'org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream', 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection', and 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request'), but it does not have any outgoing dependencies. While it is used by several classes, its lack of outgoing dependencies means it does not depend on a large number of other abstractions, which is a key characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Therefore, it does not exhibit the smell of Hub-like Modularization."
