{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.LeafNode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'LeafNode' has outgoing dependencies to 6 other classes (Attributes, Document, Node, Validate, Element, QuietAppendable) and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes (Printer, Evaluator, StructuralEvaluator, NodeEvaluator, XmlTreeBuilder). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, where 'LeafNode' acts as a central point connecting multiple abstractions."
