{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator' has incoming dependencies from 6 other classes and outgoing dependencies to 1 other class, creating a total of 7 dependencies. This high number of dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to many other abstractions both incoming and outgoing, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
