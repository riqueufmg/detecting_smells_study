{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Entities.EscapeMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (EntitiesData) and 1 incoming dependency (Entities). The incoming dependency from Entities shows it depends on 9 classes, but this represents Entities' dependencies, not EscapeMode's. EscapeMode itself maintains minimal dependencies, not exhibiting hub-like modularization with numerous incoming and outgoing connections."
