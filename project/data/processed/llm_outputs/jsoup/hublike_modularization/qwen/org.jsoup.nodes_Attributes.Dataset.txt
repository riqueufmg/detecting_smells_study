{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes.Dataset",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 outgoing dependencies (Attribute and Attributes) and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependencies show that this class depends on a small number of abstractions, not a large number, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
