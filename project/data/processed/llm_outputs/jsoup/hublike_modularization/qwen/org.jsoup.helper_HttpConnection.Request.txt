    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Request' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of dependencies. It has outgoing dependencies to 6 different classes: 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection', 'org.jsoup.helper.RequestAuthenticator', 'org.jsoup.Progress', 'org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil', 'org.jsoup.parser.Parser', and 'org.jsoup.Connection'. Additionally, it has incoming dependencies from 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection', which itself depends on a large number of abstractions. This central role in managing dependencies with multiple other abstractions indicates hub-like behavior."
