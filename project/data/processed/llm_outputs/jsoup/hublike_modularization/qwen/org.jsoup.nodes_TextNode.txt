{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class TextNode has outgoing dependencies to 5 other classes (Document, StringUtil, Validate, QuietAppendable, Entities) and incoming dependencies from 4 other classes (Element, Printer, HtmlTreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that TextNode acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
