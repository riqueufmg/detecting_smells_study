```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.AttributeValue",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from Safelist class. The incoming dependency shows Safelist uses 9 classes including AttributeValue, but this represents a normal usage pattern where a parent class uses its inner classes and related types, not hub-like modularization where a single class would have many diverse dependencies."
