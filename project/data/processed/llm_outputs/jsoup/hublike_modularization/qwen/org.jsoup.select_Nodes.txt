    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Nodes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class org.jsoup.select.Nodes has only 2 outgoing dependencies (org.jsoup.helper.Validate and org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil) and 2 incoming dependencies (from org.jsoup.nodes.Element and org.jsoup.select.Collector). The number of dependencies is relatively low and does not indicate hub-like modularization, which would require a large number of dependencies in both directions."
