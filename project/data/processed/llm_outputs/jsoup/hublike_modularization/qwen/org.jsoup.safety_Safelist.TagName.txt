```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.safety.Safelist.TagName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from Safelist class. The incoming dependency shows Safelist depends on TagName along with other related classes, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies. The class appears to be a simple inner class with limited coupling."
