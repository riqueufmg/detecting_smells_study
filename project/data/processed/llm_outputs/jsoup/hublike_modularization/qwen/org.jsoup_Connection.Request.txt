    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection.Request",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from Connection class. The incoming dependency list shows Connection class depends on 8 different types including Connection.Request itself, but this represents a single incoming dependency relationship, not multiple dependencies on Connection.Request. The class does not exhibit hub-like characteristics with numerous dependencies in both directions."
