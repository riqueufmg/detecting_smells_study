    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Element",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.nodes.Element' has outgoing dependencies to 28 other classes and incoming dependencies from 26 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Element' is a central abstraction with extensive interactions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
