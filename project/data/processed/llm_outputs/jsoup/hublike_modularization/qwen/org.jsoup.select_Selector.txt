{
    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Selector",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Selector class has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes (Collector, TokenQueue, Evaluator, Validate, Elements, Element, QueryParser) and incoming dependencies from 5 other classes (Element, W3CDom, Elements, QueryParser, StreamParser). This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the Selector class acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
