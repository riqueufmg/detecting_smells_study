```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.XmlDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class XmlDeclaration has outgoing dependencies to 4 classes (QuietAppendable, Document, Entities, StringUtil) and incoming dependencies from 4 classes (Document, Comment, DataUtil, XmlTreeBuilder). The class Document alone has 17 dependencies including XmlDeclaration, and also depends on XmlDeclaration creating a bidirectional dependency. XmlDeclaration is involved in dependencies with multiple abstractions both in terms of outgoing and incoming connections, indicating hub-like modularization."
