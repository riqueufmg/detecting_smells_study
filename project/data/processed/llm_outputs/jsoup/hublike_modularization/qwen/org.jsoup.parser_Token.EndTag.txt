```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.Token.EndTag",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from its enclosing class Token. The incoming dependency shows Token class depends on 12 other abstractions, but this represents the enclosing class's dependencies, not direct dependencies on Token.EndTag itself. The class does not exhibit hub-like modularization as it has minimal dependency connections."
