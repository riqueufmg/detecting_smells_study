    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser' has outgoing dependencies to 11 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. The total number of dependencies (17) is significantly high, indicating that this class acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. This central role in managing dependencies across various parts of the system justifies the detection of Hub-like Modularization."
