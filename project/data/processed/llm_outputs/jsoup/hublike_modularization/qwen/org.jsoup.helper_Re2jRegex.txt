{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.Re2jRegex",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class Re2jRegex has only one outgoing dependency to Regex and one incoming dependency from Regex, showing a bidirectional relationship with a single class rather than dependencies with a large number of other abstractions. The dependency pattern indicates a tight coupling between two specific classes rather than hub-like modularization."
