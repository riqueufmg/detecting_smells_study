    "class": "org.jsoup.select.Elements",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.select.Elements' has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and incoming dependencies from 14 other classes. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting to and being connected by a large number of other abstractions, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
