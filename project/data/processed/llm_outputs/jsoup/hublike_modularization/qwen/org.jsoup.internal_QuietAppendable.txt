    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.internal.QuietAppendable' has no outgoing dependencies but is depended upon by 14 other classes across multiple packages, particularly in 'org.jsoup.nodes'. This high number of incoming dependencies indicates it acts as a central point of reliance, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
