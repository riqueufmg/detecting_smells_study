    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader' has outgoing dependencies to 5 other abstractions and incoming dependencies from 7 other abstractions, creating a total of 12 unique dependencies. This high number of bidirectional dependencies indicates that the class acts as a hub, connecting multiple parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
