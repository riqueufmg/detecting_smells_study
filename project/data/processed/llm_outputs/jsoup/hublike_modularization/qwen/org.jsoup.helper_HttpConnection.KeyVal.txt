{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.KeyVal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency to org.jsoup.Connection and no incoming dependencies. The outgoing dependency shows the class depends on Connection interface, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
