```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 3 outgoing dependencies and 3 incoming dependencies from distinct classes. The incoming dependencies include 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection', 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response', and 'org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil', each of which also depends on multiple other abstractions. This pattern of having both a significant number of incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization."
