{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.UrlBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 outgoing dependencies to Connection, Validate, and StringUtil. While Connection has multiple dependencies (8), this represents a normal level of interaction for a connection interface. The class has no incoming dependencies from other classes. The dependency pattern shows focused interaction with helper classes and the connection API, which is typical for a builder pattern implementation and does not indicate hub-like behavior."
