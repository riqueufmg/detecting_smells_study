    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute' has outgoing dependencies to 9 other classes and incoming dependencies from 6 other classes. The total number of dependencies (15) is significantly high, indicating that this class acts as a hub connecting multiple abstractions. Specifically, it depends on classes like 'Attributes', 'Document', 'Entities', and 'Normalizer', while also being depended upon by classes such as 'Element', 'Safelist', and 'Attributes.Dataset'. This central role with numerous incoming and outgoing connections characterizes Hub-like Modularization."
