{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.CharsetDoc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (to Document) and one incoming dependency (from DataUtil). The outgoing dependencies listed are actually dependencies of the Document class, not CharsetDoc itself. The incoming dependencies show only one class (DataUtil) depending on CharsetDoc. This does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class does not have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
