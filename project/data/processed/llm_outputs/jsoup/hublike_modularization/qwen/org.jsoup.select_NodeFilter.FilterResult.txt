    "class": "org.jsoup.select.NodeFilter.FilterResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from NodeFilter class. The incoming dependency shows NodeFilter uses this class along with NodeTraversor and Node, but this does not indicate hub-like modularization as the class itself has minimal dependencies."
