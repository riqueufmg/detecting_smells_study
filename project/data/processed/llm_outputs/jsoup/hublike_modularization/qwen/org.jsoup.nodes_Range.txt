{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Range",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.nodes.Range' has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes ('org.jsoup.nodes.Node', 'org.jsoup.nodes.Range.Position', 'org.jsoup.nodes.Range.AttributeRange') and incoming dependencies from 9 classes across multiple packages. This high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates hub-like modularization, as it acts as a central point connecting various parts of the system."
