```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class XmlTreeBuilder has outgoing dependencies to 19 other classes and 1 incoming dependency from Parser. The high number of outgoing dependencies indicates it interacts with many other abstractions directly. Additionally, its incoming dependency from Parser, which itself has dependencies to multiple classes including XmlTreeBuilder, shows bidirectional coupling. This pattern of having both high outgoing and incoming dependencies with multiple abstractions characterizes Hub-like Modularization."
