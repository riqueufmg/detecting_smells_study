    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class DataNode has only 2 outgoing dependencies (QuietAppendable and Document) and 3 incoming dependencies (Element, HtmlTreeBuilder, XmlTreeBuilder). The dependencies are limited in number and do not indicate a hub-like pattern where the class acts as a central point connecting to a large number of other abstractions."
