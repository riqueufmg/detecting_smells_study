{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class W3CDom has outgoing dependencies to 7 other classes and 1 incoming dependency from NodeUtils. While it interacts with multiple abstractions, the number of dependencies is not excessively high given the context of converting between JSoup and W3C DOM structures. The dependencies are focused on core JSoup functionality (Document, Element, Selector, etc.) and internal helpers (Validate, StringUtil), which is reasonable for its role as a bridge class. There is no evidence of excessive or unnecessary dependencies that would indicate hub-like modularization."
