    "class": "org.jsoup.examples.HtmlToPlainText.FormattingVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from HtmlToPlainText class. The incoming dependency shows 7 dependencies but these represent the dependencies of the HtmlToPlainText class itself, not the FormattingVisitor. The FormattingVisitor only appears as a dependency target in the incoming dependencies, indicating it is used by HtmlToPlainText but does not create hub-like connections with multiple abstractions."
