    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.parser.Token' has outgoing dependencies to 13 other classes and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'Token' acts as a central hub connecting various parts of the system, which is characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
