    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.Regex",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.helper.Regex' has incoming dependencies from 10 different classes and outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes. The high number of incoming dependencies (from classes like 'org.jsoup.nodes.Element', 'org.jsoup.select.Evaluator', and multiple evaluators in 'org.jsoup.select') indicates that many abstractions rely on this class, which is a characteristic of Hub-like Modularization. Additionally, it has outgoing dependencies to 'org.jsoup.helper.Regex.Matcher', 'org.jsoup.internal.SharedConstants', and 'org.jsoup.helper.Re2jRegex', showing its own reliance on multiple abstractions."
