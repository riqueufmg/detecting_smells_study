    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil' has outgoing dependencies to 14 other classes and incoming dependencies from 7 other classes. The high number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies indicates that 'DataUtil' acts as a hub, connecting to a large number of abstractions in the system, which is the defining characteristic of Hub-like Modularization."
