{
    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Document.QuirksMode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from Document class. The incoming dependencies list shows Document class has many dependencies but this represents dependencies of the Document class itself, not dependencies on the QuirksMode class. QuirksMode appears to be an inner class or enum with minimal coupling to other abstractions."
