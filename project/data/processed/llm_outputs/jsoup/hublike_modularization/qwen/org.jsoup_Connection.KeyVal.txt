```json
{
    "class": "org.jsoup.Connection.KeyVal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency from Connection class. The Connection class depends on 8 different abstractions including Connection.KeyVal, but this represents a normal dependency relationship where Connection aggregates multiple types rather than Connection.KeyVal being a hub with widespread dependencies."
