    "class": "org.jsoup.examples.HtmlToPlainText",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class HtmlToPlainText has outgoing dependencies to 7 different classes across multiple packages (org.jsoup.nodes.Document, org.jsoup.examples.HtmlToPlainText.FormattingVisitor, org.jsoup.helper.Validate, org.jsoup.select.Elements, org.jsoup.nodes.Element, org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.Jsoup). Among these, several dependencies like Document, Element, Elements, Connection, and Jsoup are central abstractions with extensive outgoing dependencies themselves, indicating that HtmlToPlainText interacts with a large number of other abstractions both directly and indirectly, fulfilling the criteria for Hub-like Modularization."
