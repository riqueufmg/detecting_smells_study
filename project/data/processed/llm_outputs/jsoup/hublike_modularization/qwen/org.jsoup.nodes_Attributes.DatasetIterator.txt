    "class": "org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes.DatasetIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (Attribute) and 0 incoming dependencies. The Attribute class has 9 outgoing dependencies, but this does not make DatasetIterator a hub since DatasetIterator itself has minimal direct connections to other abstractions."
