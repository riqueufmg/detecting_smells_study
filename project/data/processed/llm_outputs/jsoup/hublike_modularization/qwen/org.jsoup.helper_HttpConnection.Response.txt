{
    "class": "org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class 'org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.Response' exhibits Hub-like Modularization due to its high number of outgoing dependencies (6) and incoming dependencies (1). It interacts with multiple classes across different packages, including 'HttpConnection', 'ControllableInputStream', 'AuthenticationHandler', 'DataUtil', 'RequestExecutor', and 'Connection'. Additionally, it is directly depended upon by 'HttpConnection', which itself has a large number of dependencies, indicating that 'Response' acts as a central point in the module interaction graph. This central role with many incoming and outgoing connections confirms the presence of Hub-like Modularization."
