High complexity measured by WMC (98) and many external dependencies. The combination of size, many public operations and complexity indicates a bloated interface and multiple responsibilities that should be split into smaller, cohesive abstractions."

Although per-method WMC is moderate (11), the sheer LOC and the many distinct evaluator roles concentrated in one class file suggest the abstraction has not been adequately decomposed and groups many responsibilities."

The class groups related structural evaluator variants (nc: 7) which reflects a cohesive family of responsibilities rather than a bloated, mixed abstraction, so it does not evidentially suffer from insufficient modularization."
