Dependency counts: bar Ca(incoming)=0, Ce(outgoing)=1 -> Instability I_bar = 1/(0+1) = 1. foo Ca(incoming)=1 (from bar), Ce(outgoing)=0 -> Instability I_foo = 0/(1+0) = 0. bar (more unstable) depends on foo (more stable), so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated; no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
