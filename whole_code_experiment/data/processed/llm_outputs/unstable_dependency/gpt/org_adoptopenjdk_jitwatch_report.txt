"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The report package's outgoing dependencies are to core/stable packages rather than to less-stable layers. For example AbstractReportBuilder imports and depends on IReadOnlyJITDataModel (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model), TreeVisitor (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor) and AbstractCompilationVisitable (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation), and Report references IMetaMember (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model). These target the central model/treevisitor/compilation packages which are foundation/core components with many incoming usages. Conversely, the report package is primarily consumed by higher-level UI and presentation code (incoming dependencies) — e.g. ViewerBytecode, ReportStage, SuggestionRowBean, EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder and various ui.report.* classes all reference org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report — indicating dependency direction from unstable/upper layers to this package. No evidence was found of the report package depending on less stable packages (i.e., stable packages depending on this unstable one) or of cyclic/contra-directional dependencies that would constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
