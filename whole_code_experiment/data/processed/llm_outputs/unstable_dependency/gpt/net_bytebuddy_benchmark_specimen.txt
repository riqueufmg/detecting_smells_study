"package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen is primarily depended upon by many benchmark classes (incoming dependencies) such as net.bytebuddy.benchmark.ClassByImplementationBenchmark, ClassByExtensionBenchmark, TrivialClassCreationBenchmark, StubInvocationBenchmark and SuperClassInvocationBenchmark which import ExampleInterface and ExampleClass. Its outgoing dependencies are minimal (ExampleInterface imports only net.bytebuddy.utility.nullability.MaybeNull). Because the package has significant incoming usage and only minor outgoing ties, it is stable and does not depend on less-stable components; therefore no Unstable Dependency is detected."
