"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Incoming dependencies: many UI classes depend on this package (e.g. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.Dialogs, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.sandbox.SandboxStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.TriView and many other UI classes call UserInterfaceUtil and other util classes). Outgoing dependencies: util classes depend on less-stable / volatile/implementation-specific APIs and higher-level concerns (e.g. UserInterfaceUtil, LocaleCell and ObservableResourceFactory import JavaFX APIs: javafx.scene.*, javafx.beans.*, javafx.scene.control.*; DisassemblyUtil, ParseUtil, JVMSUtil and others depend on model/core packages such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core). Reason: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util acts as a stable provider (many afferent couplings from UI) but contains/depends on UI-framework and higher-level logic (JavaFX imports and UI helpers), creating a stable package that depends on less-stable, high-level or volatile components. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a stable package depending on less stable/volatile packages), so an Unstable Dependency smell is present."
