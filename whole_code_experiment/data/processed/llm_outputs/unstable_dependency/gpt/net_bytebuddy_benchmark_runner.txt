"package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.runner",

"justification": "Analyzed class QuickRunner has outgoing dependencies to net.bytebuddy.benchmark (ClassByExtensionBenchmark, ClassByImplementationBenchmark, StubInvocationBenchmark, SuperClassInvocationBenchmark, TrivialClassCreationBenchmark) and to org.openjdk.jmh.runner (Runner, RunnerException, OptionsBuilder). There are no incoming dependencies provided for this package in the analyzed data. The package is a small utility/runner that depends on benchmark classes and an external, stable JMH API; there is no evidence that this package is a stable component depending on less stable components, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
