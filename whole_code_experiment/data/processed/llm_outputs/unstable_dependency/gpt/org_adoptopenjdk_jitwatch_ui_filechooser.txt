"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The ui.filechooser package (FileChooserList, FileChooserListSrcZip) has outgoing dependencies to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (UserInterfaceUtil, FileUtil) and JavaFX classes, and it has incoming dependencies from UI configuration classes (MainConfigStage, SandboxConfigStage). The direction is UI -> util (and JavaFX). The util package contains many widely used helpers (many classes in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util are referenced across the codebase) and does not depend on the UI packages, so util is the more stable component. Because filechooser depends on a more stable util package and is itself depended on by other UI packages, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle — there is no instance here of a more stable package depending on a less stable one."
