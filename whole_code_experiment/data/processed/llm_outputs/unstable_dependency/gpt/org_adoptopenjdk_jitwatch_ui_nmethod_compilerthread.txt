"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.compilerthread",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Outgoing dependencies: CompilerThreadStage directly depends on many other packages (imports): org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Compilation, CompilerThread, IMetaMember), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.AbstractNMethodStage, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil and javafx.*. Incoming dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI creates and holds CompilerThreadStage instances (see JITWatchUI.btnCompilerThreads action creating new CompilerThreadStage). This creates a bidirectional/cyclic dependency between ui.nmethod.compilerthread and ui.main (CompilerThreadStage takes a JITWatchUI parent; JITWatchUI constructs CompilerThreadStage). The analyzed package has multiple outgoing edges but very few incoming edges (primarily JITWatchUI), so it depends on other packages while being lightly depended-on itself. The presence of the cycle with a higher-level UI package (ui.main) and the many outgoing dependencies to other packages indicates an unstable-dependency architecture smell: the package depends on components (notably the main UI) in a direction that increases instability and creates a fragile cycle."
