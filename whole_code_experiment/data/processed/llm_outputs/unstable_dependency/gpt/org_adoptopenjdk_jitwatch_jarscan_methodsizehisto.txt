  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The classes in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodsizehisto (MethodSizeHistoOperation) only depend on stable, core/model abstractions and not on less-stable downstream packages. Evidence: MethodSizeHistoOperation imports core/constants and model bytecode types (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode) and the IJarScanOperation interface (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.IJarScanOperation). The large org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and model.bytecode packages contain many classes (shown in the dependent package classes), indicating they are central/stable libraries rather than unstable components. The high-level JarScan class depends on MethodSizeHistoOperation (JarScan imports org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodsizehisto.MethodSizeHistoOperation), which means the flow is from higher-level scanner to a lower-level operation implementation — not the analyzed package depending on less stable packages. Therefore there is no violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle for this package."
