"package": "com.packageName",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Outgoing dependencies: none found in com.packageName classes. Incoming dependencies: multiple classes in the default package reference types from com.packageName (e.g. PackageDotExpressions calls com.packageName.ClassInPackage.staticMethod() and several com.packageName.InnerClassContainer/InnerClassFieldContainer members; InnerStaticClassFieldDotExpressions imports com.packageName.InnerStaticClassFieldContainer). Because com.packageName has incoming references and no outgoing references to less-stable packages, it is stable and does not depend on less-stable components — therefore no Unstable Dependency detected."
