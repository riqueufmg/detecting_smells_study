"detection": true,
"justification": "StageManager (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage.StageManager) is referenced by many other packages (incoming dependencies) such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.* (NothingMountedStage, MainConfigStage, JITWatchUI, SandboxStage, etc.), indicating it is relatively stable/central. However it has outgoing dependencies on less-stable UI packages and concrete UI classes: it depends on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.ICompilationChangeListener (registerCompilationChangeListener/notifyCompilationChanged), on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage (clearChildren uses instanceof ReportStage and casts to ((ReportStage) stage).clear()), and on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil (addCloseButton). In particular, the direct use and instanceof/cast to ReportStage (a concrete UI stage) and the coupling to the ICompilationChangeListener interface in ui.main create a dependency from a widely-used/stable package to more volatile UI packages. This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle: a stable component (widely depended-on StageManager) depends on less stable UI components, so an Unstable Dependency smell is present."
