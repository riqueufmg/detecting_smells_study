"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The top-list package depends on several packages that appear less stable (low afferent coupling) than itself. Evidence: outgoing dependencies from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist include org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow (HotThrowTopListVisitable -> HotThrowFinder), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic (MostUsedIntrinsicsTopListVisitable -> IntrinsicFinder) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation/ model/ util (multiple visitables). Incoming dependencies to the toplist package are minimal — the main incoming reference is org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.toplist.TopListStage which uses the toplist API. In contrast, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow (HotThrowFinder) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic (IntrinsicFinder) are only referenced by the toplist visitables (i.e., they have very few/no other dependents). That means toplist depends on packages (hotthrow, intrinsic) that have lower stability (fewer incoming dependencies) than toplist itself, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle and indicating an Unstable Dependency smell."
