  "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache (interfaces Cache, CacheStats used by InMemoryCache, NoCache, GuavaCache, DefaultCacheStats) and external Guava classes (com.google.common.cache.*, com.google.common.math.LongMath used by GuavaCache and DefaultCacheStats). Incoming dependencies: multiple typesolver classes in com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typesolvers (CombinedTypeSolver uses InMemoryCache.create(); JavaParserTypeSolver builds/uses GuavaCache; CombinedTypeSolver and JavaParserTypeSolver cache and reference classes from this package). The symbolsolver.cache package depends on stable abstractions (the resolution.cache interfaces) and a well‑established external library (Guava), while it is itself used by several higher‑level packages (typesolvers). Therefore dependencies are directed toward more stable components and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
