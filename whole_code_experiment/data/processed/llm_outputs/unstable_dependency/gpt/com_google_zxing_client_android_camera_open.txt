"detection": true,
"justification": "Classes in com.google.zxing.client.android.camera depend on types in com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open: CameraManager imports and calls com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.OpenCamera and OpenCameraInterface (e.g. OpenCameraInterface.open(...)), CameraConfigurationManager imports com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.OpenCamera and com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open.CameraFacing, PreviewCallback and other camera classes use OpenCamera. The com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open package has outgoing dependencies to the Android framework (android.hardware.Camera, android.util.Log) and has very few incoming application-level dependencies (it is primarily used by the camera package). Because the camera package depends on the open package, which has low incoming coupling and non-trivial outgoing coupling (i.e. is less stable), this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (a package depends on a less stable package)."
