"justification": "The treevisitor package (TreeVisitor, ITreeVisitable) has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model types (IMetaMember, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, MetaClass, MetaPackage). However, it also has many incoming dependents across the codebase (toplist.*, histo.*, report.*, compilation.*, launch.*, AbstractTopListVisitable, AbstractHistoVisitable, AbstractReportBuilder, LaunchHeadless, AbstractCompilationWalker, etc.), indicating treevisitor is a stable, widely-used utility. The dependency is directed at model interfaces/central model classes (IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IMetaMember), i.e. abstractions from the core model package rather than volatile, less-stable implementation details. Because treevisitor has low outgoing coupling and high incoming usage and depends on stable model abstractions, there is no violation of the Stable Dependencies Principle here — no unstable dependency smell detected."
