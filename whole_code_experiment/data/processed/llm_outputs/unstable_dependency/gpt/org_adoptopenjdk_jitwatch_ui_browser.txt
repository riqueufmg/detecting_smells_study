"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.browser",
"detection": false,
"justification": "BrowserStage (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.browser) has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil and JavaFX APIs (javafx.scene.*, javafx.stage.*). Incoming usage is from higher-level UI code such as org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI which imports and instantiates BrowserStage (openBrowser), and StageManager which manages stages. The dependency target UserInterfaceUtil belongs to the util package which is heavily used across the codebase (examples: NothingMountedStage, ClassTree, ClassMemberList, MainConfigStage, CompilationTableBuilder and many other classes import and use UserInterfaceUtil and other util classes). Because BrowserStage depends on a widely reused, stable util package (many incoming dependencies) and only on platform JavaFX APIs, the package does not depend on less-stable packages. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell for org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.browser."
