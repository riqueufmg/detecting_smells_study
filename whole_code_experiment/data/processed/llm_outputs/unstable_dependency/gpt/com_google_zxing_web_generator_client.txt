"package": "com.google.zxing.web.generator.client",
"detection": false,
"justification": "No unstable dependency detected. The package primarily depends on stable external frameworks and standard libraries (outgoing dependencies include com.google.gwt.* (e.g. com.google.gwt.event.dom.client, com.google.gwt.user.client.ui, com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint, com.google.gwt.user.datepicker.client.DatePicker), and java.util classes such as ArrayList, List, Date, DateTimeFormat). There are many internal references among classes within the same package (same-package usage of GeneratorSource, GeneratorException, StylesDefs, Validators, etc.), but no evidence of incoming dependencies from other less-stable, volatile project packages in the provided analysis. Because the package depends on broadly stable third-party and platform libraries rather than on less-stable internal packages, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
