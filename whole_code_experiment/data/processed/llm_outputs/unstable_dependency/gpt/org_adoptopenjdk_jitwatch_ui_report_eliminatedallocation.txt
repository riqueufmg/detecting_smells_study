"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation has multiple outgoing dependencies (efferent) to core/stable packages and UI helpers: EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder imports org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.IReportRowBean, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell.LinkedBCICell and TextTableCell and JavaFX table classes; EliminatedAllocationRowBean imports org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MetaClass, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report and ReportType and extends AbstractReportRowBean. Incoming (afferent) usage is small: ReportStage constructs the table via EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder.buildTable(...) and creates EliminatedAllocationRowBean instances (see ReportStage.display()). Because this package has few incoming dependencies and depends on more central model/report packages (which are more stable), it is itself relatively unstable (many efferent, few afferent) and therefore does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle by depending on less stable components. No Unstable Dependency smell detected."
