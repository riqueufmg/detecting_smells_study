"justification": "All referenced types (RefCycleClass, RefCycleEnum, RefCycleClassFailure, RefClass2) are within the same package 'a' and only use intra-package references (including static imports and field/method access). There are no outgoing dependencies from package 'a' to other packages nor incoming dependencies from other packages in the provided code, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
