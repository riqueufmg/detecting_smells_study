  "justification": "No Unstable Dependency detected. com.example has outgoing dependencies on the well-established library package com.google.gson (examples: imports/usages of com.google.gson.Gson, GsonBuilder, TypeAdapter, TypeAdapterFactory, JsonAdapter, JsonReader, JsonWriter, TypeToken, SerializedName, JsonElement). There are no incoming dependencies from less-stable packages shown that com.example relies on. Because com.example depends on a stable external library (com.google.gson) rather than on less-stable packages, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
