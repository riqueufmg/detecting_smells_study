"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The inline package (HeadlessInlineVisitor and its nested classes) has outgoing dependencies on core, stable packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IMetaMember, Tag, IParseDictionary, LogParseException, Compilation, ParseDictionary, etc.), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation (CompilationUtil, ICompilationVisitable, AbstractCompilationVisitable), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (ParseUtil), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor (ITreeVisitable) and logging libraries. Those target packages are large, central model/compilation components (many classes shown in the dependent-package listing) and are relied on by multiple other parts of the system, indicating they are more stable. Incoming dependencies to the inline package are minimal (e.g., org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch.LaunchHeadless constructs and uses HeadlessInlineVisitor). Because org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.inline depends on more stable, core packages rather than on less stable packages, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
