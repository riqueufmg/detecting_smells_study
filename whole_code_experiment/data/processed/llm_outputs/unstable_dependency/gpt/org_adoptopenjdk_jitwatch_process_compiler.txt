"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The compiler package's outgoing dependencies are to logger (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener) and the core process package (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.AbstractProcess, IExternalProcess). These target packages are used widely across the codebase (e.g. runtime implementations and sandbox use AbstractProcess/IExternalProcess and ILogListener), indicating they are more stable. The compiler package also has several incoming dependencies (making it stable rather than unstable): LanguageManager (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang.LanguageManager) directly instantiates CompilerGroovy/CompilerJava/CompilerKotlin/etc., Sandbox (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.sandbox.Sandbox) depends on ICompiler, and RuntimeKotlin references CompilerKotlin.KOTLIN_EXECUTABLE_JAR. Because the compiler package depends on stable, widely-used packages and itself has multiple incoming dependents, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
