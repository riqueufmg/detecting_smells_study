"detection": false,
"justification": "The HistoPlotter class (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.visualiser) has outgoing dependencies to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (notably org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil) and standard/JavaFX libraries. The provided dependent package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util contains many utility classes (FileUtil, ClassUtil, ParseUtil, UserInterfaceUtil, NetUtil, JVMSUtil, etc.), indicating it is a widely-used, stable utility layer. There are no incoming dependencies from util back to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.visualiser in the provided data. Because the visualiser package depends on a broader utility package (stable) rather than on a less-stable component, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated for this package."
