"detection": false,
"justification": "Outgoing dependencies from com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder are to lower-level, widely reused packages: e.g. com.google.zxing.FormatException and com.google.zxing.ChecksumException (used for error handling), com.google.zxing.common.BitSource, BitMatrix, DecoderResult, ECIStringBuilder and many other classes in com.google.zxing.common, and com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF / ReedSolomonDecoder (used by Decoder). These target packages are core/common utilities used throughout the codebase (many classes such as BitMatrix, BitArray, BitSource, GenericGF, ReedSolomon* appear in many packages), so they are comparatively more stable. Incoming dependencies into com.google.zxing.datamatrix.decoder are from higher-level datamatrix readers (for example com.google.zxing.datamatrix.DataMatrixReader calls Decoder.decode and constructs Decoder), meaning the dependency direction is from less stable (higher-level readers) towards more stable (common libraries). Because the datamatrix.decoder package depends on stable/common packages rather than on less-stable packages, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle and therefore does not exhibit an Unstable Dependency smell."
