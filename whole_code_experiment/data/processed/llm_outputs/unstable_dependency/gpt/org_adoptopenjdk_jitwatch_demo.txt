  "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.demo",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "Outgoing dependencies are to standard Java packages (java.util: ArrayList, LinkedList, Collections, List, Random; java.lang: Math, System, Thread, String) and a third-party logging package (com.chrisnewland.freelogj.Logger, LoggerFactory). No incoming dependencies are shown for this package in the provided analysis (i.e. it appears to be a demo/leaf package). The Unstable Dependency smell requires a package that is relatively stable (many incoming dependencies) to depend on less stable packages. Here, there is no evidence that org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.demo is more stable than its dependencies — it has no observed incoming dependencies and primarily relies on stable JDK APIs. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated based on the given incoming/outgoing dependency information."
