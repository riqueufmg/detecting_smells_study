  "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "ClipboardInterface has incoming dependencies from internal packages (e.g. com.google.zxing.client.android: CaptureActivity calls ClipboardInterface.setText(...) in maybeSetClipboard; com.google.zxing.client.android.share: ShareActivity calls ClipboardInterface.getText(...) and hasText(...)). Its outgoing dependencies are only to Android framework APIs (android.content.ClipboardManager, android.content.ClipData, android.content.Context, android.util.Log) as shown by its imports. It does not depend on less-stable internal project packages, so it is not depending on less stable components and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
