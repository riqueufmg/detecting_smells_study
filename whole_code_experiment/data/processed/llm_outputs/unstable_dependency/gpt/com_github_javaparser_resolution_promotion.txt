"justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion (ConditionalExprHandler) has an outgoing dependency on com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType (see ConditionalExprHandler import of ResolvedType). The target package com.github.javaparser.resolution.types contains many core type interfaces/classes (ResolvedType, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedArrayType, ResolvedWildcard, etc.) which are widely used across the codebase. At the same time there are multiple incoming dependencies to com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion from symbolsolver modules (e.g. TypeExtractor uses ConditionalExprHandler; symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.ReferenceConditionalExprHandler, NumericConditionalExprHandler and BooleanConditionalExprHandler implement/consume ConditionalExprHandler). Because the dependency direction is from the small promotion package toward a more central, heavily reused types package (i.e., depending on a more stable core package) and many other modules depend on the promotion package, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
