"justification": "Package 'another' contains only internal types (classes A, String, MyEnum, interface A) and no outgoing dependencies to other packages are present in the analyzed code. No incoming dependencies are recorded either. Because there are no outgoing dependencies to less-stable packages, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
