"justification": "The only inter-package dependency found is main -> another (imports: 'import another.A', 'import another.*', 'import static another.MyEnum.A'; usages: Main classes reference another.A and MyEnum, and class A in main implements another.A). main has outgoing dependency to another and no incoming dependencies from other packages (incoming=0, outgoing=1, instability I=1.0). another has incoming from main and no outgoing dependencies (incoming=1, outgoing=0, instability I=0.0). The dependency direction is from the more unstable package (main) to the more stable package (another), which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle, so no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
