"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilechain has few incoming dependencies (e.g. ui.main/JITWatchUI creates CompileChainStage via openCompileChain) and several outgoing dependencies: it imports core/model packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model: Compilation, IMetaMember, IReadOnlyJITDataModel), the chain package (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain: CompileChainWalker, CompileNode), utility code (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util: UserInterfaceUtil), related UI packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main interfaces) and ui.resize. The Stable Dependencies Principle concern (a stable package depending on less stable packages) would be triggered if a highly stable/core package depended on volatile UI packages. Here the ui.compilechain package is a UI/leaf package (many efferent/outgoing deps, few afferent/incoming deps) and depends primarily on more stable core packages (model/chain/util). Therefore it is not a case of a stable package depending on less stable ones, and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
