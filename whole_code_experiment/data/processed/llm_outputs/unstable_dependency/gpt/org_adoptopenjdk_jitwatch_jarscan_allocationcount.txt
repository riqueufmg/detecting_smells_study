"detection": false,
"justification": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (IJarScanOperation) and on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode (BytecodeInstruction, IBytecodeParam, MemberBytecode, Opcode). Incoming usage of allocationcount is shown in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan which imports AllocationCountOperation. The model.bytecode package is a core, widely referenced package in the codebase (e.g. ClassBC, BytecodeInstruction, MemberBytecode, Opcode and many others), i.e. it is more stable (many consumers) than the small allocationcount subpackage. allocationcount therefore depends on a more stable/core package (model.bytecode) and is itself used by a higher-level scanner (JarScan). The dependency directions do not show a stable package depending on a less stable one, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
