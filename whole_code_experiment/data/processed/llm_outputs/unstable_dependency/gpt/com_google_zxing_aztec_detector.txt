"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.detector",
"detection": true,
"justification": "com.google.zxing.aztec.detector has outgoing dependencies on com.google.zxing.aztec (uses AztecDetectorResult) and on lower-level common packages (com.google.zxing, com.google.zxing.common, com.google.zxing.common.detector, com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon). At the same time there are incoming dependencies from com.google.zxing.aztec: AztecReader (in com.google.zxing.aztec) constructs and calls com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector (AztecReader imports Detector) and uses AztecDetectorResult returned by Detector. This creates a cyclic/bi-directional dependency between com.google.zxing.aztec.detector and com.google.zxing.aztec (Detector -> AztecDetectorResult in com.google.zxing.aztec, and AztecReader -> Detector in com.google.zxing.aztec), meaning the detector package depends on a package that depends back on it (less stable). That violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (packages should only depend on more stable packages) and constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
