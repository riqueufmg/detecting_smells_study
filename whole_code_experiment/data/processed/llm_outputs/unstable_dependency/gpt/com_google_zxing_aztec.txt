  "package": "com.google.zxing.aztec",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "com.google.zxing.aztec has multiple outgoing dependencies to more specialized, likely less-stable packages while receiving relatively few incoming dependencies. Evidence: AztecReader imports and depends on com.google.zxing.aztec.detector.Detector and com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder.Decoder; AztecWriter imports and depends on com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder.Encoder and AztecCode; AztecDetectorResult extends com.google.zxing.common.DetectorResult (depends on common). Incoming uses of this package are limited (examples: MultiFormatReader and MultiFormatWriter reference AztecReader/AztecWriter). This creates a dependency direction from a package with small afferent coupling to several more volatile/implementation-specific packages (encoder/decoder/detector), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle and indicating an Unstable Dependency smell."
