  "justification": "No unstable dependency detected. The analyzed package's outgoing dependencies are to core/low-level and stable packages (e.g. org.codehaus.groovy.ast types: AnnotatedNode, AnnotationNode, ClassNode, ConstructorNode, FieldNode, MethodNode, Parameter, Expression, BlockStatement; groovy.transform.BuilderASTTransformation; org.apache.groovy.ast.tools.ClassNodeUtils and org.codehaus.groovy.ast.tools.GeneralUtils/GenericsUtils; java.util.List/Map/ArrayList; org.objectweb.asm.Opcodes). These are foundational AST/tooling and Java standard-library packages that are expected to be more stable than this builder transform, so the dependency direction follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. No incoming-dependency data indicating this package is more stable than its dependencies is provided; there is also no evidence it depends on any less-stable, higher-level package. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
