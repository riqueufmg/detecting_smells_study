"package": "demo",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The demo package only has outgoing dependencies to com.github.javaparser.utils (imports in Main: ParserCollectionStrategy, ProjectRoot, SourceRoot, ParseResult, CompilationUnit) and has no incoming dependencies from other analyzed packages (incoming = 0, outgoing > 0 -> demo is unstable). com.github.javaparser.utils is a core utility package with many internal classes and many incoming references, i.e. it is more stable. The dependency direction is from the less-stable demo package to the more-stable com.github.javaparser.utils package, which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. There is no case where a stable package depends on a less-stable one, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
