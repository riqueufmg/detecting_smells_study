"detection": false,
"justification": "The comparators package is depended upon by the reflectionmodel package (incoming dependency) but does not depend on reflectionmodel (no outgoing dependency to it). Evidence: ReflectionClassDeclaration and ReflectionRecordDeclaration (in com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel) import and use MethodComparator (sorted(new MethodComparator())), and ReflectionClassDeclaration also relies on MethodComparator when collecting/ordering methods. The comparators classes only reference java.lang.reflect and java.util types and other comparators (ParameterComparator, ClassComparator, MethodComparator) and have no dependencies on the reflectionmodel package. Therefore the dependency direction is from the (likely more unstable) reflectionmodel package to the (more stable) comparators package, which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle; no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
