  "justification": "The assembly package has an unstable dependency cycle with the core model package. Outgoing dependencies from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly include strong references to model types: e.g. AssemblyProcessor.attachAssemblyToMembers(PackageManager) imports and uses org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.PackageManager, MemberSignatureParts, MetaClass and IMetaMember; AbstractAssemblyParser.parseAssembly and other assembly classes reference org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.LogParseException and MemberSignatureParts. At the same time there are incoming dependencies from model and UI packages back to the assembly package: Compilation stores/returns org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.AssemblyMethod (Compilation.setAssembly/getAssembly), AbstractMetaMember.addAssembly(AssemblyMethod) and getCompilationByAddress(AssemblyMethod) create direct model→assembly coupling, and HotSpotLogParser/ViewerAssembly/Viewer use AssemblyProcessor/AssemblyMethod/AssemblyInstruction. This mutual dependency (assembly → model and model → assembly) violates the Stable Dependencies Principle because a core/model component (expected to be more stable) depends on the assembler layer (less stable), creating an unstable dependency architecture smell."
