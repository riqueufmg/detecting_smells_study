"package": "a.b.c",

"justification": "Package a.b.c has an outgoing dependency to package d.e.f (ExampleClass contains 'import d.e.f.DataObjectFactory' and uses doFactory.getDataObject). In the provided code there are no incoming dependencies to a.b.c (no other packages depend on it), so its instability is high (instability = outgoing / (incoming + outgoing) = 1/(0+1) = 1.0). Because a.b.c (an unstable package) depends on another package, this violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
