"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache has outgoing dependencies to model and compilation infrastructure (e.g. uses org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.CodeCacheEvent, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation, IMetaMember and extends/uses AbstractCompilationWalker). These target packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and core compilation classes) are core/domain packages and appear more stable. Incoming dependencies originate from higher-level UI and visualization code (e.g. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.JITWatchUI and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.nmethod.codecache.CodeCacheLayoutStage reference CodeCacheEventWalker and CodeCacheWalkerResult), which are less stable user-interface layers. Because the codecache package depends on stable model/compilation components rather than on less-stable UI components, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle and therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
