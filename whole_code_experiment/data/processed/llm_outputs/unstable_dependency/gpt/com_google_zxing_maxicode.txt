"package": "com.google.zxing.maxicode",
"detection": false,
"justification": "MaxiCodeReader (com.google.zxing.maxicode) has outgoing dependencies to core/stable packages (com.google.zxing: BarcodeFormat, BinaryBitmap, Reader, Result, exceptions; com.google.zxing.common: BitMatrix, DecoderResult) and to its internal decoder subpackage (com.google.zxing.maxicode.decoder.Decoder). Those target packages are core/common infrastructure (widely used) and therefore more stable. Incoming dependency is from com.google.zxing.MultiFormatReader which instantiates MaxiCodeReader. There is no evidence that com.google.zxing.maxicode depends on less-stable packages; its only dependency on a potentially less-stable unit is the internal decoder subpackage (part of the same feature), which is an internal/expected coupling. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated for com.google.zxing.maxicode."
