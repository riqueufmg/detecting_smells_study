"package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec (classes ModulusGF, ErrorCorrection, ModulusPoly) has outgoing dependencies to higher-level, unstable packages while being a low-level error-correction component. Evidence: ModulusGF imports com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Common and uses PDF417Common.NUMBER_OF_CODEWORDS (tight coupling to the PDF417 package); ErrorCorrection references com.google.zxing.ChecksumException. Incoming dependencies include com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.PDF417ScanningDecoder which imports com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec.ErrorCorrection. This creates a dependency from the lower-level ec package to the less-stable PDF417 package (higher-level application code), violating the Stable Dependencies Principle (a package should only depend on packages more stable than itself). Therefore an Unstable Dependency smell is present."
