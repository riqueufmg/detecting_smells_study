"justification": "Outgoing dependencies: java.util (List, Map) referenced by GenericClass. Incoming dependencies: none (no other analyzed package depends on javaparser). Stability estimate: incoming=0, outgoing>0 => javaparser is unstable, but all its outgoing dependencies are to the core java.util library (a more stable package). There is no case of javaparser depending on a less-stable package than itself, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
