"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.freqinlinesize",
"detection": false,
"justification": "FreqInlineSizeOperation (in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.freqinlinesize) has outgoing dependencies on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.MemberSignatureParts, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.BytecodeInstruction, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.MemberBytecode, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.IJarScanOperation, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil and core constants. The referenced model and util packages are large, central packages (many classes from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model are present in the codebase listing), indicating they are stable with many incoming usages. Incoming references to the freqinlinesize package are minimal (JarScan constructs FreqInlineSizeOperation), so the freqinlinesize package depends on more stable packages rather than less stable ones. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
