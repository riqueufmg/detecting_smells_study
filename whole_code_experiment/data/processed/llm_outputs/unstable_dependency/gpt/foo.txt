  "justification": "Incoming dependencies: none (no other packages in the analyzed code depend on package foo). Outgoing dependencies: only to standard Java platform packages (java.util.List in foo.A and implicit java.lang usages in multiple classes). All explicit inter-package imports are internal (static import of foo.B.d and foo.JavaTest.* are intra-package). Since foo does not depend on any less-stable, external project packages but only on stable JDK packages, there is no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
