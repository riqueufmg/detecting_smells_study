"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The history package (com.google.zxing.client.android.history) is depended on by higher-level client code (incoming references from com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity — uses HistoryManager/HistoryItem — and from supplemental retrievers in com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement which call HistoryManager), indicating it is a relatively stable component. However, it has outgoing dependencies to less-stable/application-level packages: HistoryManager imports com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents and com.google.zxing.client.android.PreferencesActivity and refers to com.google.zxing.client.android.result.ResultHandler (e.g. addHistoryItem checks Intents.Scan.SAVE_HISTORY, reads PreferencesActivity keys, and accepts a ResultHandler), and HistoryItemAdapter imports android UI classes and com.google.zxing.client.android.R. This creates a dependency direction from a stable package (history) to less-stable client/application packages, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle and constituting an Unstable Dependency smell."
