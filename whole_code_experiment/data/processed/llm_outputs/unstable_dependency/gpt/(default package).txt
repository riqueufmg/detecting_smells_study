"package": "(default package)",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The default package has outgoing dependencies to com.github.javaparser.quality (e.g. multiple classes import com.github.javaparser.quality.Preconditions/NotNull) and to com.packageName (e.g. InnerStaticClassFieldDotExpressions imports com.packageName.InnerStaticClassFieldContainer). Those target packages have incoming couplings (they are depended on) and no evident outgoing dependencies, making them more stable (low instability). The default package has essentially no incoming dependencies from other packages (afferent couplings = 0) and several efferent dependencies, so it is unstable but depends on more stable packages. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated (dependencies point from unstable → stable) and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
