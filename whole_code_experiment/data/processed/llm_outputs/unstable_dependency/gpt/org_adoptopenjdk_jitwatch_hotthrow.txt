"justification": "Outgoing dependencies: HotThrowFinder in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow imports and depends on many core packages (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.AbstractCompilationVisitable, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.* including IReadOnlyJITDataModel, Compilation, IMetaMember, IParseDictionary, Tag and model.bytecode types like ExceptionTable/ExceptionTableEntry/MemberBytecode, plus util.ParseUtil). Incoming dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist.HotThrowTopListVisitable (in the toplist package) imports org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow.HotThrowFinder and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow.HotThrowResult and uses them to build toplists. The hotthrow package is very small (two classes) while toplist is a larger, higher-level package with many classes. That means a relatively unstable/specialised package (hotthrow) is being depended upon by a broader/top-level package (toplist) — the dependency direction is from a more stable/higher-level package to a less stable/specialised package, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. These incoming/outgoing dependency relationships (HotThrowTopListVisitable -> HotThrowFinder / HotThrowResult, and HotThrowFinder -> many core model/compilation/util classes) justify the detection of an Unstable Dependency smell."
