  "package": "com.google.zxing.oned.rss",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "Outgoing dependencies from com.google.zxing.oned.rss go to core/stable packages (e.g. com.google.zxing: Result, ResultPoint, NotFoundException, BarcodeFormat, DecodeHintType, ResultMetadataType, ResultPointCallback; com.google.zxing.common: BitArray, BitMatrix utilities and com.google.zxing.common.detector.MathUtils). Incoming dependencies are limited and come from a related, less-central package (com.google.zxing.oned.rss.expanded classes like RSSExpandedReader, ExpandedPair which import AbstractRSSReader, DataCharacter, FinderPattern). The dependency direction is towards central/common packages (more stable), not toward less stable packages. Therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell for com.google.zxing.oned.rss."
