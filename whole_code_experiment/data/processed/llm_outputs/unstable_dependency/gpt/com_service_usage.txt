"detection": false,
"justification": "com.service.usage has 0 incoming dependencies and 1 outgoing dependency (implements com.service.definition.ServiceDefinition). The package itself is unstable (only efferent coupling), and there is no evidence that it is a stable package depending on a less stable one. Depending on a definition/interface package (com.service.definition) does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle given the available dependency counts, so the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
