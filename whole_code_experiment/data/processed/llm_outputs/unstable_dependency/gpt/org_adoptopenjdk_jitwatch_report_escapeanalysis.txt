"detection": false,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis (AbstractEscapeAnalysisWalker) mainly has outgoing dependencies to higher-level/report and core/model packages: it extends org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.AbstractReportBuilder and uses types from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (Report, ReportType), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (Compilation, IMetaMember, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IParseDictionary, Tag, LogParseException, AnnotationException) and model.bytecode classes (BytecodeAnnotationBuilder, BytecodeAnnotations, LineAnnotation). Those target packages are large, central and clearly more stable (many classes and widely reused model and report components). There are no incoming dependencies shown from those packages back into org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.escapeanalysis and no cyclic dependency evidence in the provided code. Because the analyzed package depends on more stable, foundational packages rather than on less stable ones, the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
