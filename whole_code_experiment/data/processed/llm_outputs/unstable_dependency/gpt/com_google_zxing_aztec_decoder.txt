  "justification": "The com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder package (Decoder) has outgoing dependencies on core, stable packages: com.google.zxing.FormatException, com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecDetectorResult, com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix, com.google.zxing.common.DecoderResult, com.google.zxing.common.CharacterSetECI and the reedsolomon utilities (com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon.GenericGF, ReedSolomonDecoder, ReedSolomonException). Its main incoming usage is from com.google.zxing.aztec.AztecReader (AztecReader instantiates and calls Decoder.decode). These targets are core/shared modules (common, reedsolomon, aztec detector result) that are broadly used across the codebase and therefore represent stable packages rather than less stable, volatile ones. There is no evidence the decoder depends on a less-stable/feature package or on downstream modules that have fewer incoming references. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and an Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
