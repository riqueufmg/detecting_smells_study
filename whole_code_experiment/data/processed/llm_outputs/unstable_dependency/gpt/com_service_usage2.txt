"justification": "com.service.usage2 has a single outgoing dependency: it implements com.service.definition.ServiceDefinition (ServiceImplementation implements ServiceDefinition). There are no incoming dependencies to com.service.usage2 shown. The package depends on an interface/definition package (an abstraction that is typically more stable), so it is not depending on a less stable component. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
