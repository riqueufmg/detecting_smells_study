"justification": "Calculated package stability (I = outgoing / (incoming + outgoing)): issue1945.interfaces I=0 (incoming from implementations, main = 2; outgoing 0), issue1945.implementations I=0.5 (incoming from main =1; outgoing to interfaces =1), issue1945.main I=1.0 (incoming 0; outgoing to implementations and interfaces =2). All outgoing dependencies point to packages with equal or lower instability (main -> implementations (1.0 -> 0.5) and interfaces (1.0 -> 0.0); implementations -> interfaces (0.5 -> 0.0)); interfaces has no outgoing dependencies. Therefore no package depends on a less stable package and the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
