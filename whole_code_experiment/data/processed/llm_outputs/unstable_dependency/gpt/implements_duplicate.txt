"justification": "No outgoing or incoming package-level dependencies detected. The package contains types A, A.DuplicateTypeName (inner class) and the top-level interface DuplicateTypeName; although there are duplicate simple names and a circular type relationship (A implements DuplicateTypeName while the inner class DuplicateTypeName extends A), these relationships are internal to the same package and do not cause the package to depend on any less-stable external package. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
