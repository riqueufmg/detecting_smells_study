"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Outgoing dependencies: this package's classes (NextInstructionOperation, NextInstructionCount, NextInstructionCountList) depend on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount (SequenceCountOperation, InstructionSequence), org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode.Opcode, and core constants (JITWatchConstants). Incoming dependencies: the package is referenced by org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.JarScan (it constructs NextInstructionOperation). The Unstable Dependency smell would require this package to depend on less stable (highly changeable / low-afferent-coupling) packages. In this codebase the nextinstruction package depends on foundational/base packages: SequenceCountOperation (a lower-level, reusable base operation) and model.bytecode.Opcode (a core, widely-used model). These targets are more stable/core than the specialized nextinstruction operation. There are no outgoing dependencies from nextinstruction to higher-level, more-changeable packages, and no circular dependency. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated and an Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
