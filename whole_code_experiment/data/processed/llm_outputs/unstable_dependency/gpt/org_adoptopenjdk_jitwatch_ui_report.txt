"detection": true,
"justification": "Package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report has unstable dependencies: it both depends on many other (less stable) modules and is depended on by them, creating bidirectional/cyclic coupling that violates the Stable Dependencies Principle. Evidence of outgoing dependencies: ReportStage imports core and higher-level UI/configuration classes (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IStageAccessProxy and JITWatchUI, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.UserInterfaceUtil, javafx.*). Evidence of incoming dependencies: multiple classes in subpackages depend on the report package abstractions (e.g. org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks.OptimisedLockRowBuilder, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation.EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion.SuggestionRowBuilder, org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining.InliningRowBuilder all import org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.IReportRowBean/AbstractReportRowBean). Notably, ReportStage (in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report) depends on the row-builder classes (outgoing), while those builders depend on IReportRowBean in the parent package (incoming) — a cyclic/dependent direction opposite to stability. This bidirectional dependency indicates an Unstable Dependency smell."
