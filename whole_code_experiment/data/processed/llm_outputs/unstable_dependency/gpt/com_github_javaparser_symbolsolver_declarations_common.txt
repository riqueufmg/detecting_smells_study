"justification": "MethodDeclarationCommonLogic (in com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.declarations.common) has outgoing dependencies to core/low-level packages: com.github.javaparser.resolution (Context, TypeSolver, MethodUsage), com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations (ResolvedMethodDeclaration, ResolvedParameterDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration), com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.InferenceContext and com.github.javaparser.resolution.types (ResolvedType, ResolvedTypeVariable). These resolution.* and types/* packages are core, widely used (many incoming dependencies) and thus more stable. The only visible incoming dependency in the analyzed set is ReflectionMethodDeclaration (com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel) which constructs and uses MethodDeclarationCommonLogic. Because the analyzed package depends on more stable, foundational packages and is primarily used by higher-level reflection/symbolsolver code, there is no evidence that it depends on less stable components. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
