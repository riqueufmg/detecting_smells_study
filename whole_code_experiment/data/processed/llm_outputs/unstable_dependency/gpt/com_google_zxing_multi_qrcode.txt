  "package": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The package com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode (QRCodeMultiReader) only has outgoing dependencies to core/stable packages and interfaces: com.google.zxing (BarcodeFormat, BinaryBitmap, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException, ReaderException, Result, ResultMetadataType, ResultPoint, BinaryBitmap, etc.), com.google.zxing.common (DecoderResult, DetectorResult, BitMatrix, ResultPoint, etc.), com.google.zxing.qrcode.QRCodeReader and com.google.zxing.multi.MultipleBarcodeReader. These target packages are library-core packages that are widely used across the codebase (stable), and the analyzed package does not depend on any less-stable, specialized packages. Also, in the provided code set there are no incoming dependencies shown targeting com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode (no other package imports or depends on it), so there is no case where a more stable package depends on a less stable one. Therefore the Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
