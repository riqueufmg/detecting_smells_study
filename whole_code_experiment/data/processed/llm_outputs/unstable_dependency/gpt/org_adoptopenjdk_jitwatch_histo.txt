"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The histo package has outgoing dependencies on core/model/compilation infrastructure (examples: imports of org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.IReadOnlyJITDataModel, IMetaMember, Compilation, IParseDictionary, LogParseException, Tag in AbstractHistoVisitable/NativeSizeHistoWalker/AttributeNameHistoWalker/InlineSizeHistoVisitable; usage of org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor.TreeVisitor in AbstractHistoVisitable and AbstractCompilationWalker; usage of org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil in InlineSizeHistoVisitable; and core constants from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConstants). These target packages (model, compilation, core, treevisitor) are central and widely used across the codebase (e.g. many classes in org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and UI/graphing use them), indicating they are more stable. Incoming dependencies to the histo package are minimal (notably org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing.HistoStage imports Histo and IHistoVisitable). Because histo depends on more central/stable packages while few packages depend on histo, the dependency direction aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle; therefore there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
