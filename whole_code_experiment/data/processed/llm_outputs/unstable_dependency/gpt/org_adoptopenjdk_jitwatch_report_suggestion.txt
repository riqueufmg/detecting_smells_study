"justification": "Outgoing dependencies from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.suggestion (SuggestionWalker) are to core/model and utility packages: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.CompilationUtil; org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model (CodeCacheEvent, Compilation, IMetaMember, IParseDictionary, IReadOnlyJITDataModel, LogParseException, Tag, etc.); org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report (AbstractReportBuilder, Report, ReportType); org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util (ParseUtil, StringUtil); and the external logger. These target packages are core or widely reused (model and util) and act as stable foundations for the system (many other packages use org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util). In the provided code there are no incoming dependencies shown that make the analyzed package a widely depended-upon, stable package (no other package imports org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.suggestion in the supplied sources), and there are no dependency cycles between this package and less-stable packages. Because SuggestionWalker depends on core, stable packages (model/util/report) rather than on less-stable, higher-level modules, the Unstable Dependency smell is not detected."
