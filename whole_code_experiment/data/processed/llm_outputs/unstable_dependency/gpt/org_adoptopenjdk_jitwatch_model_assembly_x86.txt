"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The assembly package depends on the architecture-specific x86 package (org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86) while that x86 package also depends on assembly, creating a cyclic and unstable dependency direction. Evidence: AssemblyUtil.getParserForArchitecture() constructs new AssemblyParserX86(...) (reference to org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86.AssemblyParserX86), and AssemblyReference.getX86MnemonicMap()/loadReferenceFile use x86-specific resources; these are outgoing dependencies from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly to the x86 package. Conversely, AssemblyParserX86 extends AbstractAssemblyParser and AssemblyParserX86 and X86RegisterType import and use types from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly (Architecture, AssemblyUtil, AssemblyInstruction, AssemblyLabels, etc.), showing incoming dependencies into the x86 package. Because the general assembly package (used by many other components, e.g. ViewerAssembly and numerous assembly-related classes) depends on the more specialized x86 package, the Stable Dependencies Principle is violated: a more stable/core package depends on a less stable/specialized one. This constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
