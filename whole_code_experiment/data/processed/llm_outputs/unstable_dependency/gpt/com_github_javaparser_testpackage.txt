"justification": "No unstable dependency detected: the package com.github.javaparser.testpackage contains TestClass which declares no imports or references (no outgoing dependencies) and there are no incoming dependencies shown in the analyzed set. Because it has zero outgoing dependencies it cannot depend on less-stable packages and therefore does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
