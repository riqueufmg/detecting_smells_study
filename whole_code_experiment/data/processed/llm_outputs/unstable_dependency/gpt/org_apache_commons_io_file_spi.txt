"package": "org.apache.commons.io.file.spi",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package depends only on stable Java platform APIs (java.nio.file.FileSystems, java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider, java.net.URI, java.net.URL, and java.util classes). These are more stable than library packages, and there are no indications of incoming dependencies from less stable components that would invert the stability direction. Hence the Stable Dependencies Principle is satisfied and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
