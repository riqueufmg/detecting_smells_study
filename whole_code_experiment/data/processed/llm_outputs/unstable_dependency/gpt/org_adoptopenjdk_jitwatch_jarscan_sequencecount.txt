"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount has an unstable dependency: SequenceCountOperation (in this package) depends on the IJarScanOperation interface from org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan (import org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.IJarScanOperation). At the same time, classes in the jarscan tree depend on concrete types from this package: JarScan instantiates SequenceCountOperation (JarScan.getJarScanOperation) and org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction.NextInstructionOperation extends SequenceCountOperation. This creates a cyclic/unstable dependency direction (sequencecount -> jarscan and jarscan -> sequencecount). Although sequencecount's dependency on model.bytecode (Opcode, MemberBytecode, BytecodeInstruction) targets a stable domain model, depending on the higher-level jarscan package (IJarScanOperation) while jarscan depends on concrete classes in sequencecount violates the Stable Dependencies Principle and constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
