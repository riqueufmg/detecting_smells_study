"justification": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector (classes: Detector, PDF417DetectorResult) has outgoing dependencies on more-central packages (imports: com.google.zxing.BinaryBitmap, DecodeHintType, NotFoundException, ResultPoint and com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix). The dependent/common packages (com.google.zxing and com.google.zxing.common) contain many core classes used across the codebase (e.g. BitMatrix, BitArray, BinaryBitmap, Binarizer, etc.), indicating higher stability. Incoming dependencies to com.google.zxing.pdf417.detector are limited (e.g. com.google.zxing.pdf417.PDF417Reader calls Detector.detect), so the dependency direction is from this less-stable feature package toward more-stable core packages. Therefore the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and an Unstable Dependency smell is not present."
