"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share",
"detection": false,
"justification": "Analyzed outgoing dependencies from com.google.zxing.client.android.share: ShareActivity, BookmarkPickerActivity, BookmarkAdapter, AppPickerActivity, LoadPackagesAsyncTask and AppInfo import/use classes in android.* (framework), com.google.zxing (core library: BarcodeFormat, Contents, BinaryBitmap, etc.), and com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard.ClipboardInterface. Incoming usage: CaptureActivity (in com.google.zxing.client.android) starts ShareActivity (see CaptureActivity.onOptionsItemSelected), showing the share package is not unusually central/stable. The most significant outgoing dependency is on com.google.zxing (the core library) and on the Android framework — both are clearly more stable and widely depended-upon. The only small internal dependency is com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard.ClipboardInterface (used for clipboard operations), which is a lightweight utility; it does not make the share package depend on a less-stable, highly volatile component. Given that com.google.zxing.client.android.share depends primarily on stable external/core packages (and only on small, utility internal packages) and it has incoming references (e.g., CaptureActivity), there is no evidence that this package depends on less-stable packages in a way that violates the Stable Dependencies Principle."
