"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.suggestion",
"detection": true,
"justification": "Outgoing dependencies: SuggestionRowBuilder and SuggestionRowBean depend on org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report and ReportType, on ui.report types (IReportRowBean, AbstractReportRowBean) and on ui.report.cell classes (IntegerTableCell, MemberTableCell, TextWrapTableCell, TextTableCell) and JavaFX API. Incoming dependencies: org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.ReportStage imports and instantiates SuggestionRowBuilder/SuggestionRowBean. This produces a cyclic dependency between ui.report (higher-level UI stage) and the ui.report.suggestion subpackage: suggestion depends on ui.report.AbstractReportRowBean/IReportRowBean while ui.report.ReportStage depends on suggestion. Because the package both depends on and is depended on by a less-abstract UI package (creating a cycle) it violates the Stable Dependencies Principle (depends on less stable component), so an Unstable Dependency smell is present."
