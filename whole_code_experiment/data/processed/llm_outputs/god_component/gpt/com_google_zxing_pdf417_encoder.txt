    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a large number of classes (PDF417, PDF417HighLevelEncoder, PDF417ErrorCorrection, BarcodeMatrix, BarcodeRow, Dimensions, PDF417HighLevelEncoderTestAdapter, Compaction enum, etc.) and multiple very large classes with extensive responsibilities. PDF417HighLevelEncoder and PDF417 are long, complex classes implementing full high-level encoding and low-level layout/encoding logic (many methods, large control flow, and heavy algorithmic code). PDF417 contains very large constant tables (CODEWORD_TABLE) and PDF417ErrorCorrection also includes large EC_COEFFICIENTS arrays and non-trivial algorithms. The package implements many distinct responsibilities (text/byte/numeric compaction, ECI handling, error correction, matrix/row construction, dimension calculation and low-level bit pattern encoding) concentrated in a few huge classes, indicating excessive size and responsibility for the component."
