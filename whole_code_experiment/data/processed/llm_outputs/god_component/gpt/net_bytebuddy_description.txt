    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.description contains an excessive number of large types and very long type definitions in a single component. Key elements: multiple top-level interfaces such as NamedElement (with several nested sub-interfaces), DeclaredByType (and WithMandatoryDeclaration), TypeVariableSource (with Visitor, AbstractBase, NoOp), ByteCodeElement (with Token/TokenList, Member, TypeDependant) and a very large ModifierReviewable interface with many nested interfaces and a huge AbstractBase implementation. Many of these types are lengthy (ModifierReviewable.AbstractBase alone defines numerous modifier-interpretation methods) and the provided input shows repeated, very long declarations totaling thousands of lines. The combination of many classes/interfaces and very large implementations in the same package indicates an excessively large component consistent with the God Component smell."
