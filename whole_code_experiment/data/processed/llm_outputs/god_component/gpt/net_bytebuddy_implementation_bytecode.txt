    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode contains a very large number of classes and enums handling many responsibilities: arithmetic/opcode enums (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Remainder, Negation, ShiftLeft, ShiftRight and their Unsigned/WithFlip variants), core interfaces and large nested types (StackManipulation with many nested classes: Illegal, Trivial, Size, AbstractBase, Compound, Simple and Dispatcher), ByteCodeAppender (with nested Size, Compound, Simple), StackSize, TypeCreation, Throw, Removal, Duplication and more. Several types themselves are sizeable and include multiple inner types and implementations, indicating high lines-of-code and concentrated functionality in one package. The variety of concerns (stack manipulation primitives, byte code appending, size calculations, type creation) and the large number of classes grouped together justify classifying this package as a God Component."
