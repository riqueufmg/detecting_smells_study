    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains a small set of cohesive top-level types (CollectionFactory, ArrayAccess, ArrayFactory, ArrayLength) with a few nested/inner types that are directly related to array creation and access. Responsibilities are tightly focused on collection/array bytecode manipulation (array creation, element access, length, and a collection factory interface). Although ArrayFactory and ArrayAccess contain multiple inner classes and non-trivial implementations, they implement clearly related behaviors (ArrayCreator variants, Loader/Putter inner classes) rather than unrelated functionality. The number of top-level classes (4) and the class responsibilities indicate cohesion rather than an excessively large god component."
