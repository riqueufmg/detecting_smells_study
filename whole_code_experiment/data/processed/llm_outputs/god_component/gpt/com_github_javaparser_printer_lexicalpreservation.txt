    "justification": "The package contains a very large, highly cohesive implementation that centralizes many responsibilities and a large number of classes and long methods. Key indicators: (1) Very large classes with many responsibilities (LexicalPreservingPrinter handles setup, token mapping, observer registration, node text storage and printing; Difference implements extensive diff-apply logic with very long methods such as apply and many helpers; LexicalDifferenceCalculator contains many nested types and complex model calculation methods). (2) Complex algorithms and control flow spread across multiple huge classes (DifferenceElementCalculator, ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor, Difference, Resolved/Added/Removed/Kept types) indicating >single-responsibility behavior. (3) Numerous classes and inner classes are defined under the same package (LexicalDifferenceCalculator + CalculatedSyntaxModel + CsmChild, NodeText, Difference, DifferenceElementCalculator, LexicalPreservingPrinter + Observer, Reshuffled, RemovedGroup, etc.), and many methods are very long and complex (heavy LOC per class). Together these point to an excessively large component (in classes and LOC) that exhibits the God Component smell."
