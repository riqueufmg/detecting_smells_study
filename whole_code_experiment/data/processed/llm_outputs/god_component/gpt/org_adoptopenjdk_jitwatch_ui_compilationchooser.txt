    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.compilationchooser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The provided package contains a single, focused class (CompilationChooser) of modest size (around 70–90 lines) with a small number of fields and simple methods (constructor, clear, setVisible, compilationChanged, getCombo). Its responsibilities are narrowly UI-related (managing a ComboBox and forwarding selection events) and it delegates model data access to IMetaMember/Compilation. There is no evidence of excessive LOC, many classes, or overly broad responsibilities that would indicate a God Component."
