    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains at least one God Component: DecodeServlet. DecodeServlet is very large (many imports and long implementation) and centralizes many responsibilities: request parameter parsing and validation, URI/URL handling and network I/O (HttpURLConnection), content-type and size checks, image reading (ImageIO), pixel/size validation, image decoding logic (multiple decoding strategies and binarizers), result formatting/dispatching, and error-response construction. It also manages DoS-related state via fields and timers. This concentration of diverse functionality (HTTP handling, network I/O, image processing, decoding algorithm orchestration, and view/error rendering) in a single class indicates excessive lines of code and multiple responsibilities, consistent with the God Component smell."
