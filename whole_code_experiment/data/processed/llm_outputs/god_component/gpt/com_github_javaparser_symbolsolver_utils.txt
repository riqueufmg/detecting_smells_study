    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains four distinct classes (SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy, ModuleLayerHelper, FileUtils, JavassistModuleHelper) each with focused responsibilities: collection of source roots and type solvers, reflective module-layer helpers, small file utilities, and parsing module-info via Javassist. There is no single class that dominates the package with an excessive amount of code nor an excessive number of classes in the package. Based on the provided sources, class sizes are moderate and responsibilities are separated, so the package does not meet the definition of a God Component."
