    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package 'extends_duplicate' contains only three class declarations (A, its inner class A.DuplicateTypeName, and DuplicateTypeName) with minimal/empty bodies and no indication of large lines-of-code or an excessive number of classes. There is no single overwhelmingly large class or package-level aggregation of many classes, so the information provided does not support detection of a God Component."
