    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.file.spi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains a single small class (FileSystemProviders) with a single private field (providers), a few simple methods (installed, getFileSystemProvider overloads, constructor) and a small constant. The class delegates lookups to FileSystems and installed FileSystemProvider instances and does not contain a large number of methods, fields, or internal classes. There is no evidence of excessive lines of code or many classes in the package that would indicate a God Component."
