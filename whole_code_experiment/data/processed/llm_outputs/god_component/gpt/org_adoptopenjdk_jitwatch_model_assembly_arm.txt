    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package shows a strong imbalance: five of the classes are small enums/POJOs (MnemonicEntry, ARMExtend, ARMDirective, ARMRegisterType, ARMShifter) while one class, AssemblyParserARM, contains extensive parsing logic and many responsibilities. AssemblyParserARM defines large regex patterns, multiple complex methods (createInstruction, parseInstruction, isConstant, isRegister, isJump, isShift, isExtend, extractRegisterName), stateful parsing loops and many conditional behaviours — effectively combining parsing, tokenization, validation and classification. The concentration of size and varied responsibilities in a single class while the rest of the package are tiny utility types indicates a God Component (one excessively large class dominating the package)."
