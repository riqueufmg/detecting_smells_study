    "justification": "The package contains a single class (ServiceImplementation) with a very small implementation: one simple method (getValue) returning a constant string, no fields, no additional classes, and minimal lines of code. There is no evidence of excessive LOC, high class count, or aggregated responsibilities that would indicate a God Component."
