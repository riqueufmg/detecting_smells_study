    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.quality",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single small utility class (Preconditions). The class is ~60 lines, implements a handful of simple static validation methods (checkArgument, checkNotNull variants) with low complexity and no large number of classes in the package. There is no evidence of excessive LOC or many classes concentrated in this component, so it does not meet the criteria for a God Component."
