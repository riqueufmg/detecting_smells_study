    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The provided package contains multiple focused validator classes (ModifierValidator, CommonValidators, RecordDeclarationValidator, VarValidator, NoUnderscoresInIntegerLiteralsValidator, NoBinaryIntegerLiteralsValidator, UnderscoreKeywordValidator). Responsibilities are separated by purpose (modifier checks, common validations, record checks, var usage, literal rules, underscore keyword), and no single class clearly dominates with excessive responsibilities. While ModifierValidator is the largest in the snippet, it remains narrowly focused on modifier validation. No explicit LOC or class-count metrics indicate an excessive size for a God Component, so there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."
