    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package content shown consists of a single, very large class HotSpotLogParser that implements many unrelated responsibilities: reading/splitting the log file (splitLogFile, handleLogLine), parsing header/compilation/assembly lines (parseHeaderLines, parseLogCompilationLines, parseAssemblyLines), building classpath and class model (buildParsedClasspath, buildClassModel, buildParsedClasspath(String), buildClassModel(String)), tag handling and dispatch (handleTag with a large switch and many tag-specific handlers), VM/version detection, error handling, IO handling, and assembly processing orchestration. The class contains numerous methods and extensive logic in one place (high lines-of-code and method count) rather than being decomposed into multiple focused classes. The concentration of diverse functionality in this single class and package matches the characteristics of a God Component."
