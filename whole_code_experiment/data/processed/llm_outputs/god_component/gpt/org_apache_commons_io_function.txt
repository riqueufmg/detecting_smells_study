    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package org.apache.commons.io.function contains an excessive number of classes/interfaces (~34 distinct types in the provided listing) and several very large types (notably IOStream with many streaming/IO methods and Uncheck/Erase with many wrapper methods). Responsibilities are wide-ranging: core IO functional interfaces, adapters, unchecked wrappers, iterators/spliterators, stream implementations, constants and utility classes. The high class count combined with large classes and many cross-cutting responsibilities indicates the package is excessively large and exhibits the God Component smell."
