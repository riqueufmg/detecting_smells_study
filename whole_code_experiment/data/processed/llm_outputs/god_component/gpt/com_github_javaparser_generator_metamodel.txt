    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package centralizes a large amount of generation logic and many responsibilities into a small set of classes. MetaModelGenerator alone contains a very large ALL_NODE_CLASSES list enumerating dozens of AST node types and coordinates parsing, printing, and overall generation (main, generate, and helper methods). NodeMetaModelGenerator implements complex analysis and code-generation logic (type analysis, constructor/field/method handling, file creation), and the package also contains several tightly coupled helper generators (InitializePropertyMetaModelsStatementsGenerator, InitializeConstructorParametersStatementsGenerator, AstTypeAnalysis). The concentration of many responsibilities, large data structures (the extensive ALL_NODE_CLASSES), and substantial class/method size indicate the package is excessively large/complex and matches the God Component smell."
