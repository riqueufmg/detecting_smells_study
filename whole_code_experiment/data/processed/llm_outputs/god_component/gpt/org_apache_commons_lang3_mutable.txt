    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.lang3.mutable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a set of small, focused classes (e.g. MutableByte, MutableBoolean, MutableDouble, MutableInt, MutableShort, MutableLong, MutableFloat, MutableObject and the Mutable interface). Responsibility is split by type: each class implements a single, cohesive role (a mutable wrapper for a specific primitive/Object). There is no single excessively large class or class that aggregates most functionality; methods within each class are tightly related to the wrapped type (constructors, getters/setters, arithmetic operations, toString, equals/hashCode). The overall number of classes is moderate and each class is small and single-responsibility, so the package does not exhibit an excessively large component characteristic of a God Component."
