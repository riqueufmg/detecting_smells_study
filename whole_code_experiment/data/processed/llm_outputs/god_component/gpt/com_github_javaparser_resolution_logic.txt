    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains many closely-related but substantial classes (at least 7: FunctionalInterfaceLogic, MethodResolutionCapability, ConflictingGenericTypesException, InferenceContext, InferenceVariableType, MethodResolutionLogic, ConstructorResolutionLogic). Several classes are very large and complex (notably MethodResolutionLogic and InferenceContext) with long methods (e.g. multiple isApplicable / findMostApplicable variants, extensive type-substitution and inference logic). Responsibilities concentrated here include method/constructor resolution, generic type inference, inference-variable management, functional-interface detection and utility interfaces — indicating excessive size and many responsibilities concentrated in one component. The number of classes and the large size/complexity of key classes support detection of a God Component."
