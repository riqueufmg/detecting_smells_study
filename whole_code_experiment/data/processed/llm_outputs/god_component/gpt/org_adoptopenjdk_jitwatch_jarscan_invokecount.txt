    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only three small, focused classes (InvokeMethodCountMap, MethodCountMap, InvokeCountOperation). Responsibilities are separated: MethodCountMap manages counts and sorting/formatting, InvokeMethodCountMap groups counts by Opcode, and InvokeCountOperation scans bytecode and delegates counting. No single class aggregates large numbers of methods or diverse responsibilities, and there is no evidence of excessive lines of code or an unusually high number of classes in this component. Therefore the God Component smell is not present."
