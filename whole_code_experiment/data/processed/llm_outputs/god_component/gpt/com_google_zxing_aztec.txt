    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a small number of focused classes (AztecWriter, AztecReader, AztecDetectorResult) with well-scoped responsibilities: AztecWriter handles encoding/rendering, AztecReader handles detection/decoding, and AztecDetectorResult is a simple data holder. No single class dominates the package or contains an excessive number of methods or responsibilities, and the responsibilities are clearly separated, so there is no evidence of an excessively large (God) component."
