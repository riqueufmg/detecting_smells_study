    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "groovy.transform.builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The provided package contains a single class (DefaultStrategy). While the class has several methods, it is focused on a single cohesive responsibility (generating builder helper classes) and breaks logic into many small private helper methods (createBuilder, createBuilderMethod, createBuildMethod, createBuilderMethodForProp, createFieldCopy, initializeInstance, etc.). The source shown is moderately sized but does not exhibit an excessive number of classes or an extreme LOC concentration that would indicate a God Component. Given only one class in the package and that the class responsibilities are cohesive and decomposed, the evidence does not support marking this package as a God Component."
