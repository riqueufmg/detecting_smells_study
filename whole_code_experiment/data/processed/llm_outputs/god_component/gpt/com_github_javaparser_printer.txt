    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains an excessive number of classes and very large classes with multiple responsibilities: numerous printer implementations (XmlPrinter, YamlPrinter, DotPrinter, DefaultPrettyPrinter, PrettyPrinter, ConfigurablePrinter/Printer) co-exist in the same package; very large visitor/printer classes (PrettyPrintVisitor and DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor) implement dozens of visit(...) methods (hundreds of lines each) indicating very high LOC and responsibility; ConcreteSyntaxModel has an enormous static initialization mapping many node types (large static block), increasing class size and complexity; SourcePrinter is a substantial support class managing indentation/cursor logic. Together these indicate a component that is excessively large (many classes — > a dozen — and multiple classes with very high LOC and mixed responsibilities), matching the God Component smell."
