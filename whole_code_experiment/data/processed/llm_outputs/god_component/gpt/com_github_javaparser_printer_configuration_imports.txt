    "justification": "The package contains three small, focused classes (DefaultImportOrderingStrategy, IntelliJImportOrderingStrategy, EclipseImportOrderingStrategy). Each class implements a single responsibility (different import ordering strategies) with a small number of short methods (sortImports, a setter, a getter) and no large data fields. There is no single excessively large class or an excessive number of classes in this package, nor long/complex methods that would indicate a God Component."
