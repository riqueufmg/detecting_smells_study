    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.example",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a small number of types (ConstructorParameterTest, Beta, Beta.CustomInterface, Alpha, Alpha.CustomInterface) and each type is very small: simple fields, tiny constructors, or empty interfaces. No single class shows an excessive number of lines of code or an excessive number of contained classes/responsibilities that would indicate a God Component. The provided sources are short and focused, so there is insufficient evidence of an overly large component."
