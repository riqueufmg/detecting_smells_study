    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains a single small enum class (PathSensitivity) with only four enum constants and no methods or large implementation. There is no indication of excessive LOC, many classes, or multiple responsibilities — the component is minimal and focused, so it does not meet the criteria for a God Component."
