    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is dominated by a single, very large component: GraphAdapterBuilder (with nested Factory, Graph and Element classes). GraphAdapterBuilder implements builder responsibilities (instanceCreators, constructor construction, addType, registerOn) and also contains the full graph-serialization/deserialization logic via the nested Factory.type adapter (complex create() returning a TypeAdapter with long write() and read() methods), Graph (map, queue, nextCreate, nextName) and Element (value lifecycle, read/write). These combined responsibilities (building/registering adapters, instance creation hook, graph state management, queueing, serialization/deserialization and recursive instance handling) and the large amount of code concentrated in one top-level class indicate excessive size and responsibility concentration consistent with the God Component smell."
