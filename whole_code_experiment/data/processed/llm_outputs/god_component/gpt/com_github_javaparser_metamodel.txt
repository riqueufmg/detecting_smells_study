    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.metamodel contains an excessive number of classes and very large centralized initialization logic. Evidence: the JavaParserMetaModel class holds a nodeMetaModels list and three very large initializer methods (initializeNodeMetaModels, initializePropertyMetaModels, initializeConstructorParameters) that add and wire together many dozens of distinct *MetaModel classes (e.g., NodeMetaModel, BaseNodeMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, and a long list of specific meta-model classes such as ClassOrInterfaceDeclarationMetaModel, MethodDeclarationMetaModel, ArrayCreationExprMetaModel, SwitchStmtMetaModel, etc.). The initializeConstructorParameters method alone contains hundreds of add(...) calls, and initializeNodeMetaModels populates the list with dozens of entries. This concentration of many classes and large amounts of code and wiring in a single package/class indicates an excessively large component (God Component) by LOC and class count."
