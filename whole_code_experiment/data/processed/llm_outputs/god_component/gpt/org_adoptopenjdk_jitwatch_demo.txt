    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.demo",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is dominated by a single large class MakeHotSpotLog that contains dozens of methods and several hundred lines of code, concentrating many unrelated responsibilities in one place. The class implements a wide range of functionality (test harness construction, arithmetic helpers, branching tests, intrinsic/array-copy tests, sorting, multiple call-chain chains, leaf methods, string upper-casing, loop-unrolling tests, a large 'bigMethod', padding/sleep logic and the main entry point). This high method count (around 35–40 methods), varied responsibilities and large LOC indicate an excessively large component, consistent with the God Component smell."
