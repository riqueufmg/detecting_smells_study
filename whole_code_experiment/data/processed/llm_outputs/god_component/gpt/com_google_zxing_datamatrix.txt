    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The provided package contains only two classes (DataMatrixReader and DataMatrixWriter). Each class has focused, cohesive responsibilities (reading/detecting/decoding vs encoding/writing Data Matrix codes). While the classes are non‑trivial in size, there is no evidence of an excessively large component by class count or overwhelmingly large LOC concentrated in a single component. The code is split into clear steps (detection/decoding, encoding/ECC/placement, low‑level matrix conversion), indicating reasonable separation of concerns. Given the available information, there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."
