    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two small interfaces (DirectoryProperty and Directory). Both are lightweight: DirectoryProperty exposes a handful of methods (getAsFile, getAsFileTree, dir, set) and Directory exposes two methods (getAsFile, dir). There is no evidence of excessive lines of code, large class count, or concentration of many responsibilities in a single component, so the information does not support detecting a God Component."
