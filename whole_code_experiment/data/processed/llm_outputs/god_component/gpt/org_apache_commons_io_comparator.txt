    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.comparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a set of focused, small comparator classes (PathFileComparator, ExtensionFileComparator, SizeFileComparator, LastModifiedFileComparator, NameFileComparator, DefaultFileComparator, DirectoryFileComparator, CompositeFileComparator, ReverseFileComparator and AbstractFileComparator). No single class is excessively large in LOC or number of responsibilities; each comparator implements a single, well-scoped compare method and a few small helpers/fields. Shared functionality is factored into AbstractFileComparator and ReverseFileComparator, and CompositeFileComparator composes delegates rather than accumulating responsibilities. The package size (~10 small classes) and the limited per-class complexity indicate no God Component present."
