    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single primary top-level class ReflectionHelper with three closely related private static nested classes (RecordHelper, RecordSupportedHelper, RecordNotSupportedHelper). All code is focused on reflection utilities (making AccessibleObject accessible, generating descriptions, handling Java record reflection). The number of top-level classes is small (one), and the nested helpers are narrowly scoped abstractions supporting the main utility. There is no evidence in the provided input of an excessively large number of classes or fragmented responsibilities that would qualify as a God Component."
