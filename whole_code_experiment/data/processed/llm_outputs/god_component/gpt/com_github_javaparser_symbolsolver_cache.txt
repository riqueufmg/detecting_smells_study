    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains four classes (InMemoryCache, NoCache, GuavaCache, DefaultCacheStats). Each class has a focused, single responsibility: two simple cache implementations (InMemoryCache, NoCache), a wrapper for Guava cache (GuavaCache), and an immutable stats holder with related operations (DefaultCacheStats). Although DefaultCacheStats is the largest file, its size stems from cohesive statistics logic (accessors, rate calculations, arithmetic, equals/hashCode/toString) rather than unrelated responsibilities. The number of classes and the cohesion of responsibilities do not indicate an excessively large or monolithic component, so the God Component smell is not present."
