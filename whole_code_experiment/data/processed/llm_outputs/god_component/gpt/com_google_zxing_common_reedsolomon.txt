    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a small, cohesive set of 5 classes (ReedSolomonException, GenericGF, GenericGFPoly, ReedSolomonEncoder, ReedSolomonDecoder) each with a clear, focused responsibility (field arithmetic, polynomial representation/operations, encoding/decoding, and an exception). No single class is excessively large or monolithic; logic is split across domain-appropriate classes with concise methods. The code implements a well-bounded Reed–Solomon module rather than an overly large component, so it does not exhibit the God Component smell."
