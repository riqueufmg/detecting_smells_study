    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two classes (FoundSequence and SequenceSearchOperation). FoundSequence is a small value/data class; SequenceSearchOperation, while containing the search logic, is a single cohesive component focused on sequence searching and not an excessively large class or collection of classes. There is no evidence of an excessive number of classes or an abnormally large component (in terms of LOC or class count) that would indicate a God Component."
