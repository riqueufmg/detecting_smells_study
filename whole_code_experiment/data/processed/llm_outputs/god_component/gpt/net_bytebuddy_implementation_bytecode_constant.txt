    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a very large number of classes and nested types responsible for many different responsibilities: e.g. FloatConstant (+ ConstantPool), LongConstant (+ ConstantPool), DoubleConstant (+ ConstantPool), IntegerConstant (+ SingleBytePush, TwoBytePush, ConstantPool), ClassConstant (+ ForReferenceType), FieldConstant (+ Cached), TextConstant, NullConstant, SerializedConstant, DefaultValue, JavaConstantValue (+ Visitor) and a very large MethodConstant class with many nested classes (ForMethod, ForConstructor, PrivilegedLookup, CachedMethod, CachedConstructor, CanCache, CanCacheIllegal) implementing method/constructor lookup, privileged lookup, caching and auxiliary type registration. The input shows extensive code (many lines of logic) concentrated in this single package and especially in MethodConstant, indicating high LOC and multiple responsibilities centralized here. These characteristics (many classes/types and large, complex classes handling multiple concerns) match the God Component smell (component excessively large in number of classes and lines of code)."
