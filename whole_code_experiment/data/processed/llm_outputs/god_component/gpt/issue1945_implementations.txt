    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "issue1945.implementations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only three small classes (Sheep, WoolRenderer, HairTypeWool) with minimal, focused responsibilities: Sheep returns a HairType, HairTypeWool returns a renderer, and WoolRenderer is a singleton renderer. There is no evidence of excessive lines of code, an unusually high number of classes, or multiple unrelated responsibilities consolidated in one component. No size/LOC metrics indicating bloat are provided, so the available information does not support detecting a God Component."
