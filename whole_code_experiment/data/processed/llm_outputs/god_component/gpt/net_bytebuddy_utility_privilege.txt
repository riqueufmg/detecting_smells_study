    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.utility.privilege",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only three small, single-purpose classes (GetSystemPropertyAction, GetMethodAction, SetAccessibleAction). Each class implements PrivilegedAction and provides a focused responsibility with few fields and methods (simple constructors and a single run() implementation). There is no excessive LOC or large number of classes concentrated in this package, nor a single monolithic class gathering many responsibilities, so the God Component smell is not present."
