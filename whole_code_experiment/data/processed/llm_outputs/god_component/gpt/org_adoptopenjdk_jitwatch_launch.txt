    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single large, multi‑responsibility class (LaunchHeadless) alongside a trivial launcher class (LaunchUI). LaunchHeadless implements listener interfaces, performs command‑line parsing (parseOptions and main), constructs and configures the parser, drives log processing (parser.processLogFile), builds multiple output formats (timelineBuilder, errorBuilder, HeadlessUtil.modelToString), formats and writes files (handleReadComplete, Files.write), generates suggestions (getSuggestions and SuggestionWalker usage), handles inline‑failed calls reporting, and contains many unrelated responsibilities (event handling, error handling, I/O, formatting, reporting). This concentration of diverse responsibilities and substantial code in one class indicates an excessive size / responsibility concentration consistent with the God Component smell."
