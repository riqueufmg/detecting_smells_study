    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 types (classes, interfaces, enums) but there is no evidence of excessive size or responsibility: each type shown is very small (only static final string fields, no methods or large internal structure). No metrics indicating large LOC or many collaborating classes are provided. Based on the available information (moderate number of types and minimal contents per type), the package does not meet the definition of a God Component."
