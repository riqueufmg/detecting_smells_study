    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is dominated by a very large class JavaSymbolSolver (with an inner ArrayLengthValueDeclaration) that implements a wide set of responsibilities: long resolveDeclaration(...) logic with many instanceof branches handling MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, EnumDeclaration, RecordDeclaration, EnumConstantDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration, AnnotationDeclaration, AnnotationMemberDeclaration, FieldDeclaration, VariableDeclarator, MethodCallExpr, ObjectCreationExpr, NameExpr, MethodReferenceExpr, FieldAccessExpr, ThisExpr, ExplicitConstructorInvocationStmt, Parameter, AnnotationExpr, TypePatternExpr, plus parameter resolution helpers, type conversion and calculation methods. The class spans hundreds of lines and centralizes diverse functionality (symbol resolution, type solving, parameter and record handling, injection into CompilationUnit, etc.), indicating excessive size and multiple responsibilities concentrated in one component. The package contains only a few other top-level classes (e.g. SourceFileInfoExtractor) while JavaSymbolSolver clearly dominates the codebase in LOC and responsibilities, which matches the God Component smell."
