    "justification": "The package com.google.zxing aggregates a large number of classes (24+ in the provided input) spanning many responsibilities: image/luminance handling (LuminanceSource, RGBLuminanceSource, GrayscaleLuminanceSource, PlanarYUVLuminanceSource, InvertedLuminanceSource), binarization/bitmaps (Binarizer, BinaryBitmap), decoding/readers (Reader, MultiFormatReader, Result, ResultPoint, ResultMetadataType, ResultPointCallback, DecodeHintType), encoding/writers (Writer, MultiFormatWriter, EncodeHintType, WriterException), and several exception and utility types (ReaderException, FormatException, ChecksumException, NotFoundException, BarcodeFormat, Dimension). This concentration of many classes and diverse responsibilities within a single package indicates an excessively large component that centralizes core functionality, matching the God Component smell."
