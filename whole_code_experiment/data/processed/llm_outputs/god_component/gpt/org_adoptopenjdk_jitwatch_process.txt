    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two types: the small interface IExternalProcess (2 methods) and AbstractProcess (one cohesive abstract class responsible for running external processes and related utilities). The class count is low (2) and AbstractProcess, while non-trivial, implements a focused set of related responsibilities (temp stream files, reading output/error, building classpath, platform suffix helpers, and running commands). There is no evidence of an excessively large number of classes or an unbounded Lines Of Code concentration indicating a God Component."
