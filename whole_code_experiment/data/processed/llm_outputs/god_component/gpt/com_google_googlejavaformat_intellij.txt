    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a modest number of focused classes (GoogleJavaFormatConfigurable, GoogleJavaFormatImportOptimizer, UiFormatterStyle, Notifications, JreConfigurationChecker, GoogleJavaFormatSettings (and its State/EnabledState), GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService and its nested GoogleJavaFormatFormattingTask). No single class dominates the codebase with an excessive number of responsibilities: most classes are small and single-purpose (settings holder, UI configurable, notification helper, JRE checker, import optimizer, formatting service). The largest class (GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService and its nested task) is sizeable but clearly focused on formatting tasks. Based on the provided sources there is no evidence of an excessively large component in terms of lines of code or an unusually high number of classes concentrated in a single component, so the God Component smell is not detected."
