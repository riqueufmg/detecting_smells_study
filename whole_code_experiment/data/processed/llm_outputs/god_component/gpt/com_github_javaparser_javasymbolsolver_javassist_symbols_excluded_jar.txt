    "justification": "The package contains only two types (SuperClassExcludedJar and InterfaceExcludedJar). Each type declares a single static final String field and no methods or additional classes. There is no evidence of excessive Lines Of Code or a large number of classes in this package, so it does not meet the criteria for a God Component."
