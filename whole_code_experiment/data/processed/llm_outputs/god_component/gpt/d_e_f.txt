    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package d.e.f contains only one class (DataObjectFactory) with a minimal body: a single method getDataObject returning null. There is no evidence of large Lines Of Code or a high number of classes in the package. The class appears small and lightweight (low LOC), so it does not meet the definition of a God Component. The duplicated class listing appears to be a repetition in the input rather than an indication of many classes."
