    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains a single class (FileTimes) focused on time conversion and helper methods. The class is cohesive (NTFS/Unix/FileTime/Date conversions, arithmetic helpers, and constants) and does not indicate an excessive number of classes in the package. The class size (a moderate number of small, well-scoped methods and constants) does not exhibit the extreme lines-of-code concentration typical of a God Component. Based on the provided information, there is insufficient evidence of an excessively large component by either metric (many classes or extreme LOC)."
