    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.instructioncount",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed component is a single class (InstructionCountOperation) with a small, focused API: two fields (opcodeCountMap, limit) and four methods (constructor, getReport, count, processInstructions). The logic is simple (counting/opcode aggregation and sorting) and there is no indication of excessive lines of code, an excessive number of classes in the package, or an overly large dependency graph. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to classify this package/class as a God Component."
