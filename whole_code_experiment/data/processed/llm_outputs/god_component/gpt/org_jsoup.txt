    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The org.jsoup package in the provided input contains an excessively large amount of code and responsibilities concentrated in a few components. Evidence: the Connection interface alone is very large (many hundreds of lines) and defines numerous methods (newRequest, url, proxy, userAgent, timeout, maxBodySize, data(...), requestBody(...), header(...), headers(...), cookie(...), cookies(...), parser(...), get(), post(), execute(), response handling, etc.) plus multiple nested interfaces/types (Method enum, Base, Request, Response, KeyVal) — indicating high LOC and many operations. The Jsoup class is also large with many parse/parseBodyFragment/clean/isValid overloads, handling both parsing and sanitization. The package further includes multiple exception and utility types (UnsupportedMimeTypeException, HttpStatusException, SerializationException, Progress), showing many classes and varied responsibilities grouped together. These factors (very high LOC in key types and many classes/nested types with mixed responsibilities) justify detecting the God Component smell for org.jsoup."
