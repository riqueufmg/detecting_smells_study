    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a small number of classes (ReportStageType enum, IReportRowBean interface, ReportPackageFilter, ReportStage, AbstractReportRowBean) — five elements shown — and most classes are small/trivial (enum, interface, AbstractReportRowBean, ReportPackageFilter). While ReportStage is the largest class and centralises UI setup, filtering and switching logic for different report types, the package delegates type-specific construction and row representations to builder and row-bean classes located in subpackages (e.g., suggestion, eliminatedallocation, inlining, locks). There is therefore a clear separation of responsibilities and no evidence of an excessively large component by number of classes or overall LOC within this package, so the God Component smell is not detected."
