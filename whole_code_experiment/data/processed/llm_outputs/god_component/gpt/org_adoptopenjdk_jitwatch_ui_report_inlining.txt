    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.inlining",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two small classes (InliningRowBuilder and InliningRowBean). InliningRowBuilder is a focused UI helper that builds a TableView with several short column setup blocks and no complex logic or large methods. InliningRowBean is a simple row bean with a few small getters and minor string parsing. There is no evidence of excessive lines of code, a large number of classes, or multiple unrelated responsibilities that would indicate a God Component."
