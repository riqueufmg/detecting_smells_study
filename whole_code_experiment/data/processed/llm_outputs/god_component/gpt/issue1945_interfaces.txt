    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only three small, focused types (HairType, HairyAnimal, HairTypeRenderer). Each type has a single, well-scoped responsibility: HairType is a generic interface, HairyAnimal exposes a HairType, and HairTypeRenderer is an abstract renderer with one protected abstract method and a small final proxy method. There is no evidence of excessive lines of code, a large number of classes, or merged unrelated responsibilities that would indicate a God Component."
