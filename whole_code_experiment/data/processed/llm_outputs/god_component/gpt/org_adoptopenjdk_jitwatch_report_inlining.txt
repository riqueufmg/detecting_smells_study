    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed component (class InliningWalker) is a single, focused class with a small number of methods (constructor, visit, filterLineAnnotation, findNonMemberReports, visitTag) and limited responsibilities (building bytecode annotations and producing reports). There is no evidence of excessive lines of code or a large number of classes in this package from the provided input. The class logic is cohesive and confined to inlining-related reporting, so it does not meet the definition of a God Component."
