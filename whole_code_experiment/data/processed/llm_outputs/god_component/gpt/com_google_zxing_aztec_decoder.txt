    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single very large class Decoder that aggregates many responsibilities: bit extraction from the matrix (extractBits), Reed–Solomon error correction and un-stuffing (correctBits), high-level character decoding and state machine (getEncodedData, Table enum, character tables), byte/bit packing utilities (readCode, readByte, convertBoolArrayToByteArray), ECI/encoding handling, and the public decode entry point. The class defines many large static data tables, an inner data holder (CorrectedBitsResult), and numerous long, complex methods (notably getEncodedData and correctBits) with high conditional and algorithmic complexity. These facts (one class doing parsing, error correction, decoding, mapping, and I/O-related conversion) indicate excessive size and multiple responsibilities, matching the God Component smell."
