    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a large number of classes with substantial logic and varied responsibilities: SimpleStreamReader, ControllableInputStream, SimpleBufferedInput, SoftPool, StringUtil (large utility class with many methods and an inner StringJoiner), QuietAppendable (with nested BaseAppendable and StringBuilderAppendable), Functions, SharedConstants, and Normalizer. Several classes (StringUtil, ControllableInputStream, SimpleBufferedInput) are large in terms of lines of code and contain complex behavior (I/O buffering/decoding, stream control, string utilities and pooling). The package groups unrelated concerns (I/O stream management and buffering, pooling, string utilities/normalization, constants, appendable wrappers), indicating a concentration of code and responsibilities consistent with a God Component smell."
