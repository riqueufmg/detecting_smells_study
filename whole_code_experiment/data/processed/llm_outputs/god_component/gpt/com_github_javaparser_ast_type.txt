    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package com.github.javaparser.ast.type contains a large number of related top-level classes and complex types (at least: UnionType, ArrayType (with nested ArrayBracketPair and Origin), PrimitiveType (with Primitive enum), TypeParameter, UnknownType, ReferenceType, ClassOrInterfaceType, IntersectionType, Type, ConvertibleToUsage, VarType, VoidType, WildcardType). Several classes are large and implement substantial logic (for example ArrayType has many helper methods like wrapInArrayTypes/unwrapArrayTypes and an inner ArrayBracketPair class; ClassOrInterfaceType contains complex resolution and scope/type-argument handling; Type is a large abstract base with many casting helpers; PrimitiveType defines an enum and mapping). The quantity of classes (13+) in a single package along with multiple long, responsibility-heavy classes indicates the component is excessively large in terms of number of classes and lines of code, consistent with the God Component smell."
