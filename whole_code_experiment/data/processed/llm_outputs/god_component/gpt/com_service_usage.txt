    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.service.usage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single small class (ServiceImplementation) with a trivial method returning a constant string. There is only one class and very few lines of code, no evidence of many responsibilities, large LOC, or a high number of classes that would indicate an excessively large component. Therefore the God Component smell is not present."
