    "smell": "God Component",

    "justification": "The package com.service.definition contains a single interface ServiceDefinition with one method (getValue()). There are no multiple classes, no large number of lines of code, and no signs of excessive responsibilities or size. Therefore it does not meet the definition of a God Component."
