    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a collection of focused validator-related classes (Validator, TypedValidator, VisitorValidator, TreeVisitorValidator, SingleNodeTypeValidator, SimpleValidator, Validators, ProblemReporter, ReservedKeywordValidator, RecordAsTypeIdentifierNotAllowed) — about 10 small, cohesive classes. No single class dominates the implementation (no extremely large class or excessive LOC in the provided sources); responsibilities are separated (visitor-based validators, composition of validators, problem reporting). Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of a single excessively large component in terms of lines of code or an unbounded number of classes, so the God Component smell is not detected."}
