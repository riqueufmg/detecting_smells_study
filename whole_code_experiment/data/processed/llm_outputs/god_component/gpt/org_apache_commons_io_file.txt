    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.file",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a very large number of classes and a single extremely large utility class that centralizes many responsibilities. Examples of classes in this package include: DeletingPathVisitor, CleaningPathVisitor, CountingPathVisitor, CopyDirectoryVisitor, AccumulatorPathVisitor, SimplePathVisitor, NoopPathVisitor, DirectoryStreamFilter, PathFilter, PathVisitor, DeleteOption/StandardDeleteOption, FilesUncheck, Counters (with many inner counter classes), and the very large PathUtils (with large inner RelativeSortedPaths and many dozens of methods). PathUtils alone implements a wide range of unrelated file-system behaviors (copy, delete, compare, read/write, permissions, traversal helpers, POSIX/DOS handling, stream helpers, size/count utilities, etc.), and the package groups visitor implementations, filtering, counters and delete option logic together. The combination of (1) many classes in the same component and (2) an excessively large class with many responsibilities indicates a God Component smell."
