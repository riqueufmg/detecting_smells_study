    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.util",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains a single class (ISO8601Utils) focused on ISO-8601 date formatting and parsing. The class implements a cohesive set of related responsibilities (format, parse, and small helper methods like padInt, parseInt, checkOffset, indexOfNonDigit). There is no evidence of an excessive number of classes in the package nor of unrelated responsibilities spread across many classes. While the class is moderately sized, the code is domain-focused (date utilities) rather than a sprawling, multifaceted component—insufficient evidence to classify the package as a God Component."
