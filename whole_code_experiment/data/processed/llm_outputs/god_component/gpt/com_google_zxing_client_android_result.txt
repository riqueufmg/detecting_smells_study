    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a large number of classes (~14 distinct classes shown: ProductResultHandler, ResultHandlerFactory, EmailAddressResultHandler, TextResultHandler, GeoResultHandler, ISBNResultHandler, ResultHandler, URIResultHandler, ResultButtonListener, SMSResultHandler, AddressBookResultHandler, TelResultHandler, WifiResultHandler, CalendarResultHandler), indicating high class-level concentration. In particular, ResultHandler is very large and centralizes many unrelated responsibilities and utilities: contact creation (addContact, addEmailOnlyContact, addPhoneOnlyContact), intent launching and error handling (launchIntent, rawLaunchIntent), multiple communication helpers (sendEmail, sendSMS, sendMMS, dialPhone), URL/product/book search helpers (openURL, openProductSearch, openBookSearch, fillInCustomSearchURL), calendar event creation (addCalendarEvent), phone/email/address type mapping, formatting, preference parsing, and more. This central class exhibits high complexity, many methods, and multiple responsibilities (violating single responsibility and indicating excessive size/role), while the package overall groups many handler types around this single heavy component. These factors support detection of the God Component smell."
