    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.monitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package centralizes a large amount of functionality in a single class (FileAlterationObserver) which contains many responsibilities and methods: builder logic, file comparison (toComparator), listener management (addListener/removeListener/getListeners), file tree traversal and change detection (checkAndFire, checkAndNotify, createFileEntry, listFileEntries, listFiles, sort), event dispatch (fireOnCreate, fireOnChange, fireOnDelete), initialization and lifecycle (initialize, destroy, toString) and an inner Builder. FileAlterationObserver alone occupies a large portion of the package's behavior and code surface, while related concerns (monitoring thread management in FileAlterationMonitor, file state in FileEntry, serialization in SerializableFileTime, listener API and adaptor) are present but the observer class aggregates the majority of logic. The concentration of many responsibilities/methods in FileAlterationObserver (and related duplicated large blocks in the provided input) indicates a God Component smell at package org.apache.commons.io.monitor."
