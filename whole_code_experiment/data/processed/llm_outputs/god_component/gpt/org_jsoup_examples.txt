    "justification": "The package contains a small set of example classes (ListLinks, HtmlToPlainText with a single inner FormattingVisitor, and Wikipedia). Class sizes are modest: ListLinks and Wikipedia are short example utilities, and HtmlToPlainText—while the largest—is a focused example (~200 lines) implementing formatting logic with one nested visitor class. There is no single excessively large class by lines of code nor an excessive number of classes in the package that would indicate a God Component."
