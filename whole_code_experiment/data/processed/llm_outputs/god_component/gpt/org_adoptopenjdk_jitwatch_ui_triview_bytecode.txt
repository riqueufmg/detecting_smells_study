    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is dominated by a single, very large class ViewerBytecode which contains many fields and a large number of methods implementing multiple responsibilities: UI rendering and styling, tooltip construction, bytecode-to-line mapping, annotation handling, navigation and control-key logic, suggestion highlighting, offset/OSR range computation, event handlers for mouse clicks, network/download logic to fetch the JVM Spec (JVMS) in a background thread, and Platform.runLater callbacks. BytecodeLabel is very small while ViewerBytecode centralizes diverse concerns (parsing/building annotations, UI interaction, navigation stack integration, report handling, and I/O/networking). This concentration of functionality and size indicates an excessive component size and multiple responsibilities consistent with the God Component smell."
