    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains four cohesive classes (ConditionalExprResolver, ReferenceConditionalExprHandler, NumericConditionalExprHandler, BooleanConditionalExprHandler). Responsibilities are well separated: the resolver delegates to specialized handlers, and each handler implements a focused algorithm for a single conditional-expression category. No lines-of-code metric was provided, and none of the classes appears overwhelmingly large or to aggregate many unrelated responsibilities—NumericConditionalExprHandler is the most complex but is focused on numeric promotion rules. There is therefore no evidence from the provided information of an excessively large component (in LOC or class count)."
