    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The TopListStage class concentrates a large amount of code and multiple responsibilities in a single class: it constructs many TopListWrapper instances (tlLargestNative, tlInlineFailReasons, tlIntrinsics, tlHotThrows, tlLargestBytecode, tlSlowestCompilation, tlMostDecompiled, tlCompilationOrder, tlCompilationOrderOSR, tlStaleTasks) inside a long constructor, builds and configures UI elements (Scene, ComboBox, TableView, TableColumn, VBox), wires multiple event listeners, contains inline anonymous AbstractTopListVisitable implementations with visit(...) logic, and handles data population (buildTableView) and selection handling. TopListWrapper is small, so the package is not large by number of classes, but TopListStage is excessively large in LOC and responsibilities (UI construction, data/model logic, event handling, and visitable construction), indicating a God Component that should be split (for example into view, controller, and visitable/builder classes)."
