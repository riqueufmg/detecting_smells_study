    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains a single class (IntrinsicFinder) rather than many classes, and the provided class is of moderate size and cohesive purpose (finding intrinsics by visiting parse tags). The class implements two main operations (findIntrinsics and visitTag) with a focused responsibility and no evidence of an excessive number of lines of code or accumulated unrelated functionality across multiple classes. There is no data in the input showing a large class count in the package or an unusually large LOC total for the package, so the information does not support detecting a God Component."
