    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single very large class SuggestionWalker that centralizes many unrelated responsibilities: parsing/traversal of parse tags (processParseTag, visitTag), handling multiple event types (handleInlineFailTag, handleBranchTag, handleCodeCacheFull, handleHotThrowNotPreallocated), report construction, and static configuration/data (large scoreMap and explanationMap plus many string constants). The class is long (hundreds of lines) and contains large switch statements, many helper methods and large static initializers, indicating high complexity and size in one component. These elements (consolidation of parsing, analysis, scoring, and report building into one oversized class) match the God Component smell: excessive size and multiple responsibilities concentrated in a single component."
