    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.parserchooser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two small types (IParserSelectedListener and ParserChooser). ParserChooser has few fields and methods (constructor, clear, getCombo) and is clearly focused on parser selection UI logic. There is no excessive LOC, no large number of classes, and no broad responsibilities or heavy dependencies that would indicate a God Component."
