    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a very large number of classes (around 20+ types shown in the input) and several extremely large, complex classes that implement many responsibilities. Notable examples: TypeInference (many methods covering the whole inference pipeline), BoundSet (very large class with extensive logic for incorporation/derivation/resolution), LeastUpperBoundLogic (lengthy LUB logic and helpers), TypeHelper (many utility responsibilities), ConstraintFormula / ReductionResult, InstantiationSet and related inference types. These classes are long, highly coupled (many inter-class references within the package) and centralize a wide range of functionality (constraint reduction, bound propagation, resolution, LUB/GLB logic, control-flow-related logic, caching). The combination of high class count, multiple very large classes and concentrated responsibilities matches the God Component smell (excessively large component handling too many concerns)."
