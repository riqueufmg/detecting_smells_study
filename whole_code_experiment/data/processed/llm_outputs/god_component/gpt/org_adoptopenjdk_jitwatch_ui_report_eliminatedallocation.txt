    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two small classes (EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder and EliminatedAllocationRowBean). EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder has a single public buildTable method that configures TableView columns and cell factories (focused, cohesive UI-building responsibility). EliminatedAllocationRowBean extends AbstractReportRowBean and provides a few simple getters (getCompilation, getMetaClass, getMember, getKind, getEliminatedType) to expose report data. There is no excessive number of classes, no unusually large class or files, and responsibilities are limited and cohesive, so the evidence does not indicate a God Component."
