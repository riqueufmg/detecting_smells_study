    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (PDF417Common) that is excessively large in lines of code due to very large static tables and many constants: the SYMBOL_TABLE and CODEWORD_TABLE arrays alone contain hundreds-to-thousands of entries, massively increasing the class size. PDF417Common centralizes many responsibilities (constants, large lookup data and utility methods) while the other package classes (PDF417Reader, PDF417Writer, PDF417ResultMetadata) remain comparatively small, indicating the package's functionality and code volume are concentrated in one oversized component — a textbook God Component smell."
