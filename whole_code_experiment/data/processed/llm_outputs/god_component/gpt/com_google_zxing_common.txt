    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a large number of classes (~16 shown) with substantial implementation (e.g. BitMatrix, BitArray, PerspectiveTransform, GlobalHistogramBinarizer/HybridBinarizer, DefaultGridSampler, MinimalECIInput, ECIEncoderSet, ECIStringBuilder, StringUtils, CharacterSetECI, etc.). These classes cover many distinct responsibilities: low-level bit/matrix data structures and operations, image binarization/sampling, perspective transforms, character set/ECI encoding and decoding, and general string/charset utilities. Several classes are non-trivial in size and complexity (BitMatrix/BitArray, binarizers, MinimalECIInput encoding algorithm), and there is even apparent duplication (MinimalECIInput appears repeated), all indicating the package is both large and multi-responsibility — consistent with a God Component smell."
