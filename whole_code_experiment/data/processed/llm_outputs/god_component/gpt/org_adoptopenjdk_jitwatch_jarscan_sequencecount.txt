    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only two classes (InstructionSequence and SequenceCountOperation) and neither is excessively large. InstructionSequence is a small value-type wrapper around a List<Opcode> with simple toString/equals/hashCode/compareTo and one accessor. SequenceCountOperation, while the larger class, implements a cohesive responsibility (scanning bytecode sequences, counting, sorting and reporting) with clearly separated methods (processInstructions, handleChainStartingAtIndex, storeChain, getSortedData, getReport, etc.). There is no evidence of an overly large number of classes or extreme lines-of-code concentration that would indicate a God Component."
