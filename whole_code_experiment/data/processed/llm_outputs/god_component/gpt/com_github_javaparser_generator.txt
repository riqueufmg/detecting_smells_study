    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a very large, central class (AbstractGenerator) that implements many unrelated responsibilities: parsing and handling SourceRoot/CompilationUnit, method adding/replacing logic, annotation management (add/remove/cleanup), pretty-printing for methods/enums/switches, and file parse-result logging. Several utility-like behaviors are duplicated or mirrored in Generator (e.g. annotate and add/replace method logic), indicating consolidation of varied functionality into a small set of core classes. NodeGenerator and VisitorGenerator also centralize iteration/creation logic over all meta-model node types, making this package the focal point for many generation concerns. The size and breadth of responsibilities in AbstractGenerator (many methods covering IO, AST manipulation, annotation/import maintenance, and pretty printing) plus multiple classes tightly coupled around the same core functionality justify flagging this package as a God Component."
