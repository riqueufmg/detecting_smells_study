    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": ["com.google.gson.typeadapters"],
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed package contains 3 top-level classes (UtcDateTypeAdapter, RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory, PostConstructAdapterFactory) plus an inner PostConstructAdapter. While UtcDateTypeAdapter and RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory are relatively long, their responsibilities are distinct (ISO-8601 date parsing/formatting, runtime polymorphic adapter logic, and post-construction invocation). The class count is small and functionality is separated across focused classes rather than concentrated in a single excessively large component, so there is insufficient evidence of a God Component."
