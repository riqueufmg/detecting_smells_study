    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (Detector) which, while somewhat long (several hundred lines) implements a cohesive responsibility: locating and sampling a Data Matrix in an image. The class is decomposed into focused private helper methods (detectSolid1, detectSolid2, correctTopRight, shiftToModuleCenter, transitionsBetween, sampleGrid, etc.) and delegates functionality to other components (WhiteRectangleDetector, GridSampler, BitMatrix). There is no evidence of an excessive number of classes in the package nor of multiple unrelated responsibilities bundled together; therefore the information does not support labeling this package as a God Component."
