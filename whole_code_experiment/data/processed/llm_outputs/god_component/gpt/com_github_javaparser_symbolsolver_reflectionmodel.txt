    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The reflectionmodel package contains a large number of classes (16 distinct classes in the provided excerpt: ReflectionMethodDeclaration, ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionFactory, ReflectionAnnotationDeclaration, ReflectionParameterDeclaration, ReflectionEnumDeclaration, ReflectionRecordDeclaration, ReflectionPatternDeclaration, ReflectionTypeParameter, ReflectionClassAdapter, ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic, ReflectionConstructorDeclaration, ReflectionFieldDeclaration, ReflectionEnumConstantDeclaration, ReflectionAnnotationMemberDeclaration). Several classes are large and carry many responsibilities (e.g., ReflectionClassDeclaration, ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration, ReflectionRecordDeclaration, ReflectionClassAdapter and ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic include many methods and substantial logic such as method resolution, type inference, varargs handling and ancestor resolution). There is duplicated/resimilar logic across type-specific classes (class/record/enum/interface declarations) and mixing of concerns (factories, adapters, resolution logic and AST/annotation handling) within the same package. The combination of high class count, large classes with many methods, and multiple responsibilities indicates an excessively large component consistent with the God Component smell."
