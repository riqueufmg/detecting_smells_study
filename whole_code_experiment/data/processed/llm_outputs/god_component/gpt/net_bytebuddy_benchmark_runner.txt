    "justification": "The package contains a single small class (QuickRunner) with a private constructor and a single main method that builds and runs a JMH Runner. The class is concise, has minimal logic and no large methods or many classes in the package. Since the God Component smell requires an excessively large component by LOC or number of classes, the provided data does not show excessive size or class count."
