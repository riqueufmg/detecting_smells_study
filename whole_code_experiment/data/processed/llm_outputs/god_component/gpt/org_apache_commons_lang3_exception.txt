    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a relatively large number of classes in the provided snippet (10 distinct types: ExceptionUtils, DefaultExceptionContext, ContextedException, ContextedRuntimeException, ExceptionContext, UncheckedException and several Unchecked* and CloneFailedException). More importantly, ExceptionUtils is a very large class that centralizes many responsibilities (cause introspection, root-cause traversal, stack-trace extraction/formatting, printing, rethrow/wrap logic, type/index utilities, etc.) with many long methods (e.g., getRootCauseStackTraceList, getStackFrameList, getStackTrace, getThrowableList and numerous helpers). DefaultExceptionContext and the Contexted* exceptions also bundle context handling logic. The concentration of diverse functionality and substantial code in ExceptionUtils (high LOC and many responsibilities) together with multiple related classes in the same package indicates an excessive size/responsibility concentration consistent with the God Component smell."
