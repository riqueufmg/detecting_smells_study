    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single public class (Main) with one small nested private static class (Callback). The source shown is short (Main has only a main method, a small process method, and a tiny nested callback) and does not contain an excessive number of classes or very large files. The repeated listings in the input are duplicates of the same classes, not distinct additional classes. There is no evidence of extremely high lines-of-code or many classes in this package, so it does not meet the definition of a God Component."
