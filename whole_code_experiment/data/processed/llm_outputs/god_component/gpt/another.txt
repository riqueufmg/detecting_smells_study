    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "another",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package 'another' contains a small number of types (several empty/very small declarations: multiple empty class A entries, one class String, one enum MyEnum with a single constant, and an interface A). There is no evidence of large classes or high LOC; the types are minimal/empty and the total number of distinct responsibilities is low. Therefore it does not meet the 'excessively large' criteria for a God Component."
