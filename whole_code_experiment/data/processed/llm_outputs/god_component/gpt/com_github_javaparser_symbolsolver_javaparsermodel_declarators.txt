    "justification": "The package contains a small number of classes (6: AbstractSymbolDeclarator, ParameterSymbolDeclarator, FieldSymbolDeclarator, TypePatternSymbolDeclarator, VariableSymbolDeclarator, NoSymbolDeclarator). Each class is short and focused: AbstractSymbolDeclarator is a minimal base class and the concrete declarators implement small, single-purpose getSymbolDeclarations methods. There is no single excessively large class (high LOC) nor an excessive number of classes in the package that would indicate a God Component. The responsibilities are well-separated and cohesive."
