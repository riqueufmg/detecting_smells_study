  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "Connection",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The Connection class has an excessive number of methods (over 30), which makes it difficult to understand and maintain. The class represents multiple abstractions, including request and response handling, proxy settings, and data management, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. Additionally, the class has a complex interface with many methods that perform similar tasks, such as setting headers, cookies, and data, which could be simplified and modularized."
