  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "NodeIterator",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The NodeIterator class has multiple responsibilities, including iterating over nodes, finding the next node, and removing nodes. It also has a complex implementation of the findNextNode method, which traverses the node tree in a specific order. Additionally, the class has several fields, including root, next, current, previous, and currentParent, which are used to keep track of the iteration state. The class also implements the Iterator interface, which adds to its complexity. The combination of these factors makes the class difficult to understand and maintain, justifying the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
