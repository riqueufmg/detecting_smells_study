    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "StringUtil",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The StringUtil class has excessive size and complexity, with over 30 methods performing a wide range of string-related operations, including joining, padding, whitespace normalization, and URL resolution. This suggests that the class has not been adequately decomposed, resulting in a bloated interface. Many of the methods could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions, such as a StringJoiner class, a WhitespaceNormalizer class, and a URLResolver class."
