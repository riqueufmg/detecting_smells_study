    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Attributes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Attributes class has a large number of methods (over 40) and fields (over 10), which indicates excessive size and complexity. Additionally, it handles multiple responsibilities such as attribute management, data storage, and HTML rendering, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The class also has a complex iterator implementation and a nested static class (Dataset), further contributing to its complexity."
