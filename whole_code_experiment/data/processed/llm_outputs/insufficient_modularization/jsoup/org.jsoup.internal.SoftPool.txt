    "justification": "The SoftPool class has a clear and focused responsibility of managing a thread-local pool of objects. It has a small number of methods, each with a specific purpose, and the class size is moderate. The complexity is manageable, and the interface is not bloated. The class is well-structured, and its responsibilities are not overly broad or diffuse."
