{
  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "Attributes",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The Attributes class has a large number of methods (over 40) and fields (over 10), which indicates excessive size and complexity. The class is responsible for managing attributes, including adding, removing, and iterating over them, as well as handling user data and source ranges. This suggests that the class has not been adequately decomposed, leading to a bloated interface and concentrated responsibilities. Furthermore, the class has multiple, unrelated responsibilities, such as HTML generation and dataset management, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
