  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "Cleaner",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The Cleaner class has multiple responsibilities, including cleaning documents, validating documents, and checking the validity of body HTML. It also contains a nested class, CleaningVisitor, which further increases the complexity of the Cleaner class. The class has a large number of methods, including clean, isValid, isValidBodyHtml, copySafeNodes, and createSafeElement, which are all related to different aspects of document cleaning and validation. This excessive size and complexity, combined with the concentration of multiple responsibilities, justifies the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
