  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "Safelist",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The Safelist class has a large number of methods (23) and fields (5), which indicates excessive size and complexity. The class represents an abstraction that has not been adequately decomposed, resulting in a bloated interface. The class concentrates responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions, such as tag management, attribute management, and protocol management. Additionally, some methods, such as addTags, addAttributes, and addProtocols, have multiple responsibilities and can be broken down into smaller methods. The class also has a complex constructor and multiple static factory methods, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain."
