    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Jsoup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Jsoup class has a large number of static methods (over 20) that perform a wide range of tasks, including parsing HTML, connecting to URLs, and cleaning HTML. This suggests that the class is not adequately decomposed and has excessive size and complexity. The class also has a bloated interface, with many methods that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. For example, the parsing methods could be moved to a separate Parser class, and the connection methods could be moved to a separate Connection class."
