{
  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "Connection",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The Connection class has a large number of methods (over 30) and interfaces (4), which indicates excessive size and complexity. The class represents multiple abstractions, including connection settings, request and response handling, and data processing, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The presence of multiple interfaces (Base, Request, Response, KeyVal) within the Connection class also suggests that the class is not adequately decomposed, leading to a bloated interface."
