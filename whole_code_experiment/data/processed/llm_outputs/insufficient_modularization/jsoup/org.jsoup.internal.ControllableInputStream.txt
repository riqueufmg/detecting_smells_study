    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "ControllableInputStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The ControllableInputStream class has excessive size and complexity, with 24 methods and 14 fields. It handles multiple responsibilities such as input stream control, progress tracking, and timeout management, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The class also has a high number of conditional statements and nested loops, making it difficult to understand and maintain."
