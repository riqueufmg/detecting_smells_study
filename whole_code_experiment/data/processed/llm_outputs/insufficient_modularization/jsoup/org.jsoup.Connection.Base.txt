    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Connection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Connection class has a large number of methods (over 40) and interfaces (4), which indicates excessive size and complexity. The class represents multiple abstractions, including request and response handling, connection configuration, and data processing, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. Additionally, the presence of multiple nested interfaces (Base, Request, Response, KeyVal) further contributes to the complexity of the class."
