    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Attribute",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Attribute class has excessive size and complexity, with 34 methods and multiple responsibilities such as attribute validation, HTML rendering, and namespace handling. This suggests that the class has not been adequately decomposed, leading to a bloated interface and making it difficult to understand and maintain. The class also concentrates multiple responsibilities, such as being a Map.Entry and having methods for HTML rendering, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
