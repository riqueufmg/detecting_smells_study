  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "SharedConstants",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The class SharedConstants is a final class with only static final fields and a private constructor, which indicates it is being used as a container for constants. The class does not contain any methods or instance fields, and its size and complexity are minimal. The responsibilities of this class are well-separated and focused on providing constants, which does not concentrate excessive responsibilities. Therefore, the class does not exhibit the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
