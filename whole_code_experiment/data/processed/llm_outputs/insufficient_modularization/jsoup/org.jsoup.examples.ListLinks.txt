  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "ListLinks",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The ListLinks class is responsible for multiple, unrelated tasks such as fetching a URL, parsing HTML, extracting links, media, and imports, and printing the results. This concentration of responsibilities makes the class difficult to understand and maintain. Additionally, the class has a bloated interface with multiple, unrelated methods such as print and trim, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
