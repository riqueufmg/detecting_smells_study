{
  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "StringUtil",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The StringUtil class has excessive size and complexity, with numerous methods performing a wide range of string manipulation tasks. The class has 34 methods, many of which are unrelated to each other, such as URL resolution, whitespace normalization, and character classification. This suggests that the class has not been adequately decomposed, resulting in a bloated interface. Furthermore, the class has a large number of static methods, which can make it difficult to test and maintain. The presence of nested classes, such as StringJoiner, also adds to the complexity of the class. Overall, the StringUtil class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve."
