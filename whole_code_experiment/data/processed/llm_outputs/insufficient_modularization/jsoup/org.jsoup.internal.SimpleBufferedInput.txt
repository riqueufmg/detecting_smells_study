  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "SimpleBufferedInput",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The SimpleBufferedInput class has multiple responsibilities, including managing a buffer, handling input streams, and providing methods for reading and closing the stream. The class has a large number of methods (13) and variables (9), which contributes to its complexity. Additionally, the fill() method is complex and has multiple tasks, such as filling the buffer, handling the mark position, and closing the stream if necessary. The class also has a high number of conditional statements and nested if-else blocks, which makes it difficult to understand and maintain. These factors indicate that the class has not been adequately decomposed and has excessive size and complexity, which justifies the detection of the Insufficient Modularization smell."
