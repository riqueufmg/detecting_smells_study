  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "HtmlToPlainText",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The class HtmlToPlainText has multiple responsibilities, including handling command-line arguments, making HTTP requests, parsing HTML documents, and formatting plain text. It also contains several nested classes and methods, such as FormattingVisitor and trimParents, which could be separated into their own classes. The class has a large number of lines of code and a complex interface, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The presence of multiple, unrelated tasks and the lack of clear separation of concerns justify the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
