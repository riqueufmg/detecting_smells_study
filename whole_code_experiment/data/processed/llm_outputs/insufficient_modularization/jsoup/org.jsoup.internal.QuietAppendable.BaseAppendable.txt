  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "QuietAppendable",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The QuietAppendable class is an abstract class with a clear and focused interface, and its responsibilities are properly delegated to its subclasses BaseAppendable and StringBuilderAppendable. Each subclass has a single responsibility and is relatively small and simple, which suggests that the class has been adequately modularized. The use of the template method pattern and the separation of concerns into different classes also support this conclusion."
