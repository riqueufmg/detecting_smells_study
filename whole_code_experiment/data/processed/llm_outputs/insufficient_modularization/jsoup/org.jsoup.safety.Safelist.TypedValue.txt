{
  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "Safelist",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The Safelist class has a large number of methods (23) and fields (5), which indicates excessive size and complexity. The class represents an abstraction that has not been adequately decomposed, resulting in a bloated interface. The class concentrates responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions, such as tag management, attribute management, and protocol management. The presence of multiple static factory methods (none, simpleText, basic, basicWithImages, relaxed) also suggests that the class is doing too much and could be broken down into smaller classes."
