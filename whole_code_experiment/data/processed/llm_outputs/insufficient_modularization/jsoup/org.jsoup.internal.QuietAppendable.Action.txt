  "justification": "The QuietAppendable class is an abstract class with a clear and focused interface, providing methods for appending different types of data. It has two concrete subclasses, BaseAppendable and StringBuilderAppendable, each handling specific types of appendables. The responsibilities are well-separated, and each class has a single, well-defined purpose. The class hierarchy is simple and easy to understand, with no signs of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface."
