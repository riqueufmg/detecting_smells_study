    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Connection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Connection interface has a large number of methods (over 40), which indicates excessive size and complexity. Additionally, it represents multiple abstractions, such as request and response handling, connection configuration, and data processing, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The presence of nested interfaces (Base, Request, Response, KeyVal) also suggests that the class is trying to handle too many responsibilities, leading to a bloated interface."
