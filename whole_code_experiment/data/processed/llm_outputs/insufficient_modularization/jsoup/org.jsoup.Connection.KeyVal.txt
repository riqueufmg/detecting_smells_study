    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Connection",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Connection interface has an excessive number of methods (over 40), which makes it complex and difficult to understand. Additionally, it represents multiple abstractions, such as request and response handling, connection configuration, and data processing, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The presence of nested interfaces (Request, Response, Base, KeyVal) also contributes to the complexity of the class, indicating that it has not been adequately decomposed."
