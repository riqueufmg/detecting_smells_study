    "justification": "The Normalizer class has a limited number of methods, each with a single responsibility, and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity. The methods are also relatively simple and focused on specific tasks, such as lowercasing, trimming, and normalizing strings. The class does not have a bloated interface, and its responsibilities are well-separated and cohesive."
