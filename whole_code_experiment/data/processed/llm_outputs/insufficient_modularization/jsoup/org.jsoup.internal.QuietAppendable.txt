  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "QuietAppendable",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The QuietAppendable class is an abstract class with a clear and focused responsibility, which is to provide a quiet appendable functionality. It has a simple and cohesive interface with only three abstract methods. The class is also decomposed into two subclasses, BaseAppendable and StringBuilderAppendable, each handling a specific type of appendable. The subclasses have their own specific responsibilities and are not overly complex. The wrap method provides a way to create instances of the subclasses based on the type of appendable, which helps to keep the responsibilities separate. Overall, the class and its subclasses are well-structured, and there is no evidence of excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface that would suggest Insufficient Modularization."
