    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "SimpleStreamReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The SimpleStreamReader class has multiple responsibilities, including reading from an input stream, decoding bytes to characters, and managing a buffer. It also has a complex read method with multiple loops and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The class has a large number of instance variables and methods, including bufferUp, close, and read, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. Additionally, the class is tightly coupled with the CharsetDecoder and InputStream classes, making it harder to modify or replace these dependencies."
