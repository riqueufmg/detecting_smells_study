  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "QuietAppendable",
  "detection": false,
  "justification": "The class QuietAppendable is an abstract class with a clear and focused interface, providing methods for appending characters, character sequences, and character arrays. It has two concrete subclasses, BaseAppendable and StringBuilderAppendable, each handling specific types of appendables. The responsibilities are separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions, and the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity. The interface is also not bloated, as it provides a minimal set of methods necessary for its purpose. Therefore, the class does not have the smell of Insufficient Modularization."
