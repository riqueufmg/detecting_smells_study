  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "EntitiesData",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The class EntitiesData has a large number of static final fields, which could be an indication of insufficient modularization. The class seems to be responsible for storing a wide range of entity data, which could be broken down into smaller, more cohesive classes. Additionally, the class has no methods, suggesting that it may be serving as a mere data container, which is another sign of insufficient modularization."
