    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Cleaner class has multiple responsibilities such as cleaning documents, validating documents, and checking the validity of body HTML. It also contains a nested class CleaningVisitor and several private methods like copySafeNodes, createSafeElement, which increases its complexity. The class has a large number of methods (9 methods) and a significant number of lines of code, which makes it difficult to understand and maintain. Furthermore, the class is tightly coupled with other classes like Safelist, Document, and NodeVisitor, which makes it harder to modify or extend."
