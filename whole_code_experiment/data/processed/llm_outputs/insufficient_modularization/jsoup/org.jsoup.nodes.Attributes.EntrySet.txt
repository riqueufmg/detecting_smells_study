{
  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "Attributes",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The Attributes class has excessive size and complexity, with 44 methods and multiple responsibilities, including attribute management, data storage, and HTML rendering. This suggests that the class has not been adequately decomposed, leading to a bloated interface and potential maintainability issues. Specifically, the class has a large number of methods related to attribute manipulation, data access, and iteration, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
