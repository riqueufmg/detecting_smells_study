    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "HtmlToPlainText",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The HtmlToPlainText class has multiple responsibilities, including handling command-line arguments, making HTTP requests, parsing HTML documents, and formatting plain text. It also contains a nested class, FormattingVisitor, which further increases its complexity. The class has a large number of methods and variables, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The presence of complex logic, such as the append method in FormattingVisitor, and the use of multiple conditional statements, contribute to the class's excessive size and complexity."
