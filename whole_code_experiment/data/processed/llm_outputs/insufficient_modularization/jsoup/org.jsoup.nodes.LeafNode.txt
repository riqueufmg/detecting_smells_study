{
  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "class": "LeafNode",
  "detection": true,
  "justification": "The LeafNode class has multiple responsibilities, including managing its value, attributes, and parent node. It also contains methods for handling URLs, base URIs, and cloning, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The class has a large number of methods (23) and instance variables (at least 2), which contributes to its complexity and size. Furthermore, the ensureAttributes method modifies the class's state in a way that could be considered surprising, as it changes the type of the value field from a String to an Attributes object. This complexity and mixture of responsibilities suggest that the LeafNode class has not been adequately decomposed, leading to the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
