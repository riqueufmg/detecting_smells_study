    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Cleaner",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Cleaner class has multiple responsibilities such as cleaning documents, validating documents, and checking the validity of body HTML. It also contains a nested class CleaningVisitor, which further increases its complexity. The class has a large number of methods, including clean, isValid, isValidBodyHtml, copySafeNodes, and createSafeElement, which perform different tasks. This excessive size and complexity indicate that the class has not been adequately decomposed, resulting in a bloated interface and making it difficult to understand and maintain."
