    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": "Safelist",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The Safelist class has a large number of methods (over 20) and fields (over 10), which indicates excessive size and complexity. Additionally, the class has multiple responsibilities, including managing tags, attributes, enforced attributes, and protocols, which could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions. The class also has a complex constructor and several static factory methods, which further contribute to its complexity."
