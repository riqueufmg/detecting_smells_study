# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.integration.android;
public final class IntentResult {
    private final String contents;
    private final String formatName;
    private final byte[] rawBytes;
    private final Integer orientation;
    private final String errorCorrectionLevel;
    IntentResult() {
        this(null, null, null, null, null);
    }
    IntentResult(String contents, String formatName, byte[] rawBytes, Integer orientation, String errorCorrectionLevel) {
        this.contents = contents;
        this.formatName = formatName;
        this.rawBytes = rawBytes;
        this.orientation = orientation;
        this.errorCorrectionLevel = errorCorrectionLevel;
    }
    public String getContents() {
        return contents;
    }
    public String getFormatName() {
        return formatName;
    }
    public byte[] getRawBytes() {
        return rawBytes;
    }
    public Integer getOrientation() {
        return orientation;
    }
    public String getErrorCorrectionLevel() {
        return errorCorrectionLevel;
    }
    public String toString() {
        int rawBytesLength = rawBytes == null ? 0 : rawBytes.length;
        return "Format: " + formatName + '\n' + "Contents: " + contents + '\n' + "Raw bytes: (" + rawBytesLength + " bytes)\n" + "Orientation: " + orientation + '\n' + "EC level: " + errorCorrectionLevel + '\n';
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
