# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.result;
public final class SMTPResultParser extends ResultParser {
    public EmailAddressParsedResult parse(Result result) {
        String rawText = getMassagedText(result);
        if (!(rawText.startsWith("smtp:") || rawText.startsWith("SMTP:"))) {
            return null;
        }
        String emailAddress = rawText.substring(5);
        String subject = null;
        String body = null;
        int colon = emailAddress.indexOf(':');
        if (colon >= 0) {
            subject = emailAddress.substring(colon + 1);
            emailAddress = emailAddress.substring(0, colon);
            colon = subject.indexOf(':');
            if (colon >= 0) {
                body = subject.substring(colon + 1);
                subject = subject.substring(0, colon);
            }
        }
        return new EmailAddressParsedResult(new String[] { emailAddress }, null, null, subject, body);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
