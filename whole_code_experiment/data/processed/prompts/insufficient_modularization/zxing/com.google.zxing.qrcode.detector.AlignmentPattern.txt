# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector;
public final class AlignmentPattern extends ResultPoint {
    private final float estimatedModuleSize;
    AlignmentPattern(float posX, float posY, float estimatedModuleSize) {
        super(posX, posY);
        this.estimatedModuleSize = estimatedModuleSize;
    }
    boolean aboutEquals(float moduleSize, float i, float j) {
        if (Math.abs(i - getY()) <= moduleSize && Math.abs(j - getX()) <= moduleSize) {
            float moduleSizeDiff = Math.abs(moduleSize - estimatedModuleSize);
            return moduleSizeDiff <= 1.0f || moduleSizeDiff <= estimatedModuleSize;
        }
        return false;
    }
    AlignmentPattern combineEstimate(float i, float j, float newModuleSize) {
        float combinedX = (getX() + j) / 2.0f;
        float combinedY = (getY() + i) / 2.0f;
        float combinedModuleSize = (estimatedModuleSize + newModuleSize) / 2.0f;
        return new AlignmentPattern(combinedX, combinedY, combinedModuleSize);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
