# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing;
public final class Dimension {
    private final int width;
    private final int height;
    public Dimension(int width, int height) {
        if (width < 0 || height < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    public int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }
    public int getHeight() {
        return height;
    }
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (other instanceof Dimension) {
            Dimension d = (Dimension) other;
            return width == d.width && height == d.height;
        }
        return false;
    }
    public int hashCode() {
        return width * 32713 + height;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return width + "x" + height;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
