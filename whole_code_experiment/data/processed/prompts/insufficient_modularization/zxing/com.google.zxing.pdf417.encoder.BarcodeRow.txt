# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder;
final class BarcodeRow {
    private final byte[] row;
    private int currentLocation;
    BarcodeRow(int width) {
        this.row = new byte[width];
        currentLocation = 0;
    }
    void set(int x, byte value) {
        row[x] = value;
    }
    private void set(int x, boolean black) {
        row[x] = (byte) (black ? 1 : 0);
    }
    void addBar(boolean black, int width) {
        for (int ii = 0; ii < width; ii++) {
            set(currentLocation++, black);
        }
    }
    byte[] getScaledRow(int scale) {
        byte[] output = new byte[row.length * scale];
        for (int i = 0; i < output.length; i++) {
            output[i] = row[i / scale];
        }
        return output;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
