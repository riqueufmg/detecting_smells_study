# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.result;
public final class EmailAddressParsedResult extends ParsedResult {
    private final String[] tos;
    private final String[] ccs;
    private final String[] bccs;
    private final String subject;
    private final String body;
    EmailAddressParsedResult(String to) {
        this(new String[] { to }, null, null, null, null);
    }
    EmailAddressParsedResult(String[] tos, String[] ccs, String[] bccs, String subject, String body) {
        super(ParsedResultType.EMAIL_ADDRESS);
        this.tos = tos;
        this.ccs = ccs;
        this.bccs = bccs;
        this.subject = subject;
        this.body = body;
    }
    public String getEmailAddress() {
        return tos == null || tos.length == 0 ? null : tos[0];
    }
    public String[] getTos() {
        return tos;
    }
    public String[] getCCs() {
        return ccs;
    }
    public String[] getBCCs() {
        return bccs;
    }
    public String getSubject() {
        return subject;
    }
    public String getBody() {
        return body;
    }
    public String getMailtoURI() {
        return "mailto:";
    }
    public String getDisplayResult() {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(30);
        maybeAppend(tos, result);
        maybeAppend(ccs, result);
        maybeAppend(bccs, result);
        maybeAppend(subject, result);
        maybeAppend(body, result);
        return result.toString();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
