# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector;
public final class MultiDetector extends Detector {
    private static final DetectorResult[] EMPTY_DETECTOR_RESULTS = new DetectorResult[0];
    public MultiDetector(BitMatrix image) {
        super(image);
    }
    public DetectorResult[] detectMulti(Map<DecodeHintType, ?> hints) throws NotFoundException {
        BitMatrix image = getImage();
        ResultPointCallback resultPointCallback = hints == null ? null : (ResultPointCallback) hints.get(DecodeHintType.NEED_RESULT_POINT_CALLBACK);
        MultiFinderPatternFinder finder = new MultiFinderPatternFinder(image, resultPointCallback);
        FinderPatternInfo[] infos = finder.findMulti(hints);
        if (infos.length == 0) {
            throw NotFoundException.getNotFoundInstance();
        }
        List<DetectorResult> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (FinderPatternInfo info : infos) {
            try {
                result.add(processFinderPatternInfo(info));
            } catch (ReaderException e) {
            }
        }
        if (result.isEmpty()) {
            return EMPTY_DETECTOR_RESULTS;
        } else {
            return result.toArray(EMPTY_DETECTOR_RESULTS);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
