# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.common;
public abstract class GridSampler {
    private static GridSampler gridSampler = new DefaultGridSampler();
    public static void setGridSampler(GridSampler newGridSampler) {
        gridSampler = newGridSampler;
    }
    public static GridSampler getInstance() {
        return gridSampler;
    }

    public abstract BitMatrix sampleGrid(BitMatrix image, int dimensionX, int dimensionY, PerspectiveTransform transform) throws NotFoundException;
    protected static void checkAndNudgePoints(BitMatrix image, float[] points) throws NotFoundException {

        }
        nudged = true;
        for (int offset = points.length - 2; offset >= 0 && nudged; offset -= 2) {
            int x = (int) points[offset];
            int y = (int) points[offset + 1];
            if (x < -1 || x > width || y < -1 || y > height) {
                throw NotFoundException.getNotFoundInstance();
            }
            nudged = false;
            if (x == -1) {

            }
            if (y == -1) {

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
