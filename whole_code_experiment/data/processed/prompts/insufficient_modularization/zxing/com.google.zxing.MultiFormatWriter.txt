# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing;
public final class MultiFormatWriter implements Writer {
    public BitMatrix encode(String contents, BarcodeFormat format, int width, int height) throws WriterException {
        return encode(contents, format, width, height, null);
    }
    public BitMatrix encode(String contents, BarcodeFormat format, int width, int height, Map<EncodeHintType, ?> hints) throws WriterException {
        Writer writer;
        switch(format) {
            case EAN_8:
                writer = new EAN8Writer();
                break;
            case UPC_E:
                writer = new UPCEWriter();
                break;
            case EAN_13:
                writer = new EAN13Writer();
                break;
            case UPC_A:
                writer = new UPCAWriter();
                break;
            case QR_CODE:
                writer = new QRCodeWriter();
                break;
            case CODE_39:
                writer = new Code39Writer();
                break;
            case CODE_93:
                writer = new Code93Writer();
                break;
            case CODE_128:
                writer = new Code128Writer();
                break;
            case ITF:
                writer = new ITFWriter();
                break;
            case PDF_417:
                writer = new PDF417Writer();
                break;
            case CODABAR:
                writer = new CodaBarWriter();
                break;
            case DATA_MATRIX:
                writer = new DataMatrixWriter();
                break;
            case AZTEC:
                writer = new AztecWriter();
                break;
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("No encoder available for format " + format);
        }
        return writer.encode(contents, format, width, height, hints);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
