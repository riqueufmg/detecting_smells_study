# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement;
final class URIResultInfoRetriever extends SupplementalInfoRetriever {
    private static final int MAX_REDIRECTS = 5;
    private final URIParsedResult result;
    private final String redirectString;
    URIResultInfoRetriever(TextView textView, URIParsedResult result, HistoryManager historyManager, Context context) {
        super(textView, historyManager);
        redirectString = context.getString(R.string.msg_redirect);
        this.result = result;
    }
    void retrieveSupplementalInfo() throws IOException {
        URI oldURI;
        try {
            oldURI = new URI(result.getURI());
        } catch (URISyntaxException ignored) {
            return;
        }
        URI newURI = HttpHelper.unredirect(oldURI);
        int count = 0;
        while (count++ < MAX_REDIRECTS && !oldURI.equals(newURI)) {
            append(result.getDisplayResult(), null, new String[] { redirectString + " : " + newURI }, newURI.toString());
            oldURI = newURI;
            newURI = HttpHelper.unredirect(newURI);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
