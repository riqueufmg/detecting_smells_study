# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.web;
public final class TimeoutFilter implements Filter {
    private ExecutorService executorService;
    private TimeLimiter timeLimiter;
    private int timeoutSec;
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) {
        executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        timeLimiter = SimpleTimeLimiter.create(executorService);
        timeoutSec = Integer.parseInt(filterConfig.getInitParameter("timeoutSec"));
    }
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
        try {
            timeLimiter.callWithTimeout(new Callable<Void>() {
                @Override
                public Void call() throws Exception {
                    chain.doFilter(request, response);
                    return null;
                }
            }, timeoutSec, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (TimeoutException | InterruptedException e) {
            HttpServletResponse servletResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;
            servletResponse.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT);
            servletResponse.getWriter().write("Request took too long");
        } catch (ExecutionException e) {
            if (e.getCause() instanceof ServletException) {
                throw (ServletException) e.getCause();
            }
            if (e.getCause() instanceof IOException) {
                throw (IOException) e.getCause();
            }
            throw new ServletException(e.getCause());
        }
    }
    public void destroy() {
        if (executorService != null) {
            executorService.shutdownNow();
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
