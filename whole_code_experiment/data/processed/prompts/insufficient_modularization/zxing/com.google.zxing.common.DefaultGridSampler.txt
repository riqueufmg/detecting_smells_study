# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.common;
public final class DefaultGridSampler extends GridSampler {
    public BitMatrix sampleGrid(BitMatrix image, int dimensionX, int dimensionY, float p1ToX, float p1ToY, float p2ToX, float p2ToY, float p3ToX, float p3ToY, float p4ToX, float p4ToY, float p1FromX, float p1FromY, float p2FromX, float p2FromY, float p3FromX, float p3FromY, float p4FromX, float p4FromY) throws NotFoundException {
        PerspectiveTransform transform = PerspectiveTransform.quadrilateralToQuadrilateral(p1ToX, p1ToY, p2ToX, p2ToY, p3ToX, p3ToY, p4ToX, p4ToY, p1FromX, p1FromY, p2FromX, p2FromY, p3FromX, p3FromY, p4FromX, p4FromY);
        return sampleGrid(image, dimensionX, dimensionY, transform);
    }
    public BitMatrix sampleGrid(BitMatrix image, int dimensionX, int dimensionY, PerspectiveTransform transform) throws NotFoundException {
        if (dimensionX <= 0 || dimensionY <= 0) {
            throw NotFoundException.getNotFoundInstance();
        }
        BitMatrix bits = new BitMatrix(dimensionX, dimensionY);
        float[] points = new float[2 * dimensionX];
        for (int y = 0; y < dimensionY; y++) {
            int max = points.length;
            float iValue = y + 0.5f;
            for (int x = 0; x < max; x += 2) {
                points[x] = (float) (x / 2) + 0.5f;
                points[x + 1] = iValue;
            }
            transform.transformPoints(points);
            checkAndNudgePoints(image, points);
            try {
                for (int x = 0; x < max; x += 2) {
                    if (image.get((int) points[x], (int) points[x + 1])) {
                        bits.set(x / 2, y);
                    }
                }
            } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException aioobe) {
                throw NotFoundException.getNotFoundInstance();
            }
        }
        return bits;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
