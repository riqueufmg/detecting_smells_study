# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.j2se;
public final class MatrixToImageConfig {
    public static final int BLACK = 0xFF000000;
    public static final int WHITE = 0xFFFFFFFF;
    private final int onColor;
    private final int offColor;
    public MatrixToImageConfig() {
        this(BLACK, WHITE);
    }
    public MatrixToImageConfig(int onColor, int offColor) {
        this.onColor = onColor;
        this.offColor = offColor;
    }
    public int getPixelOnColor() {
        return onColor;
    }
    public int getPixelOffColor() {
        return offColor;
    }
    int getBufferedImageColorModel() {
        if (onColor == BLACK && offColor == WHITE) {
            return BufferedImage.TYPE_BYTE_BINARY;
        }
        if (hasTransparency(onColor) || hasTransparency(offColor)) {
            return BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB;
        }
        return BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB;
    }
    private static boolean hasTransparency(int argb) {
        return (argb & 0xFF000000) != 0xFF000000;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
