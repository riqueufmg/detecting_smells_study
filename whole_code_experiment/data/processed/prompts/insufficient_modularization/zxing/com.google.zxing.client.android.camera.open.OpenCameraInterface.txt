# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open;
public final class OpenCameraInterface {
    private static final String TAG = OpenCameraInterface.class.getName();
    public static final int NO_REQUESTED_CAMERA = -1;
    private OpenCameraInterface() {
    }
    public static OpenCamera open(int cameraId) {
        int numCameras = Camera.getNumberOfCameras();
        if (numCameras == 0) {
            Log.w(TAG, "No cameras!");
            return null;
        }
        if (cameraId >= numCameras) {
            Log.w(TAG, "Requested camera does not exist: " + cameraId);
            return null;
        }
        if (cameraId <= NO_REQUESTED_CAMERA) {
            cameraId = 0;
            while (cameraId < numCameras) {
                Camera.CameraInfo cameraInfo = new Camera.CameraInfo();
                Camera.getCameraInfo(cameraId, cameraInfo);
                if (CameraFacing.values()[cameraInfo.facing] == CameraFacing.BACK) {
                    break;
                }
                cameraId++;
            }
            if (cameraId == numCameras) {
                Log.i(TAG, "No camera facing " + CameraFacing.BACK + "; returning camera #0");
                cameraId = 0;
            }
        }
        Log.i(TAG, "Opening camera #" + cameraId);
        Camera.CameraInfo cameraInfo = new Camera.CameraInfo();
        Camera.getCameraInfo(cameraId, cameraInfo);
        Camera camera = Camera.open(cameraId);
        if (camera == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return new OpenCamera(cameraId, camera, CameraFacing.values()[cameraInfo.facing], cameraInfo.orientation);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
