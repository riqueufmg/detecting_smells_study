# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

final class AI01392xDecoder extends AI01decoder {
    private static final int HEADER_SIZE = 5 + 1 + 2;
    private static final int LAST_DIGIT_SIZE = 2;
    AI01392xDecoder(BitArray information) {
        super(information);
    }
    public String parseInformation() throws NotFoundException, FormatException {
        if (this.getInformation().getSize() < HEADER_SIZE + GTIN_SIZE) {
            throw NotFoundException.getNotFoundInstance();
        }
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
        encodeCompressedGtin(buf, HEADER_SIZE);
        int lastAIdigit = this.getGeneralDecoder().extractNumericValueFromBitArray(HEADER_SIZE + GTIN_SIZE, LAST_DIGIT_SIZE);
        buf.append("(392");
        buf.append(lastAIdigit);
        buf.append(')');
        DecodedInformation decodedInformation = this.getGeneralDecoder().decodeGeneralPurposeField(HEADER_SIZE + GTIN_SIZE + LAST_DIGIT_SIZE, null);
        buf.append(decodedInformation.getNewString());
        return buf.toString();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
