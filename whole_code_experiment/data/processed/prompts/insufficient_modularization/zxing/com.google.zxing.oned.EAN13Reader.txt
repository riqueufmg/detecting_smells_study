# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.oned;
public final class EAN13Reader extends UPCEANReader {
    static final int[] FIRST_DIGIT_ENCODINGS = { 0x00, 0x0B, 0x0D, 0xE, 0x13, 0x19, 0x1C, 0x15, 0x16, 0x1A };
    private final int[] decodeMiddleCounters;
    public EAN13Reader() {
        decodeMiddleCounters = new int[4];
    }
    protected int decodeMiddle(BitArray row, int[] startRange, StringBuilder resultString) throws NotFoundException {
        int[] counters = decodeMiddleCounters;
        counters[0] = 0;
        counters[1] = 0;
        counters[2] = 0;
        counters[3] = 0;
        int end = row.getSize();
        int rowOffset = startRange[1];
        int lgPatternFound = 0;
        for (int x = 0; x < 6 && rowOffset < end; x++) {
            int bestMatch = decodeDigit(row, counters, rowOffset, L_AND_G_PATTERNS);
            resultString.append((char) ('0' + bestMatch % 10));
            for (int counter : counters) {
                rowOffset += counter;
            }
            if (bestMatch >= 10) {
                lgPatternFound |= 1 << (5 - x);
            }
        }
        determineFirstDigit(resultString, lgPatternFound);
        int[] middleRange = findGuardPattern(row, rowOffset, true, MIDDLE_PATTERN);
        rowOffset = middleRange[1];
        for (int x = 0; x < 6 && rowOffset < end; x++) {
            int bestMatch = decodeDigit(row, counters, rowOffset, L_PATTERNS);
            resultString.append((char) ('0' + bestMatch));
            for (int counter : counters) {
                rowOffset += counter;
            }
        }
        return rowOffset;
    }
    BarcodeFormat getBarcodeFormat() {
        return BarcodeFormat.EAN_13;
    }
    private static void determineFirstDigit(StringBuilder resultString, int lgPatternFound) throws NotFoundException {
        for (int d = 0; d < 10; d++) {
            if (lgPatternFound == FIRST_DIGIT_ENCODINGS[d]) {
                resultString.insert(0, (char) ('0' + d));
                return;
            }
        }
        throw NotFoundException.getNotFoundInstance();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
