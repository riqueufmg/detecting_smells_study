# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.qrcode.decoder;
public enum Mode {
    TERMINATOR(new int[] { 0, 0, 0 }, 0x00),
    NUMERIC(new int[] { 10, 12, 14 }, 0x01),

    FNC1_FIRST_POSITION(new int[] { 0, 0, 0 }, 0x05),
    FNC1_SECOND_POSITION(new int[] { 0, 0, 0 }, 0x09),
    HANZI(new int[] { 8, 10, 12 }, 0x0D);

                return ECI;
            case 0x8:
                return KANJI;
            case 0x9:
                return FNC1_SECOND_POSITION;
            case 0xD:
                return HANZI;
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
    }
    public int getCharacterCountBits(Version version) {
        int number = version.getVersionNumber();
        int offset;
        if (number <= 9) {
            offset = 0;
        } else if (number <= 26) {
            offset = 1;
        } else {
            offset = 2;
        }
        return characterCountBitsForVersions[offset];
    }
    public int getBits() {
        return bits;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
