# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement;
final class TitleRetriever extends SupplementalInfoRetriever {
    private static final Pattern TITLE_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("<title>([^<]+)");
    private static final int MAX_TITLE_LEN = 100;
    private final String httpUrl;
    TitleRetriever(TextView textView, URIParsedResult result, HistoryManager historyManager) {
        super(textView, historyManager);
        this.httpUrl = result.getURI();
    }
    void retrieveSupplementalInfo() {
        CharSequence contents;
        try {
            contents = HttpHelper.downloadViaHttp(httpUrl, HttpHelper.ContentType.HTML, 4096);
        } catch (IOException ioe) {
            return;
        }
        if (contents != null && contents.length() > 0) {
            Matcher m = TITLE_PATTERN.matcher(contents);
            if (m.find()) {
                String title = m.group(1);
                if (title != null && !title.isEmpty()) {
                    title = Html.fromHtml(title).toString();
                    if (title.length() > MAX_TITLE_LEN) {
                        title = title.substring(0, MAX_TITLE_LEN) + "...";
                    }
                    append(httpUrl, null, new String[] { title }, httpUrl);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
