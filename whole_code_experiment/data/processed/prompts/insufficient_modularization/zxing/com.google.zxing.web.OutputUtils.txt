# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.web;
public final class OutputUtils {
    private static final int BYTES_PER_LINE = 16;
    private static final int HALF_BYTES_PER_LINE = BYTES_PER_LINE / 2;
    private OutputUtils() {
    }
    public static String arrayToString(byte[] bytes) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(bytes.length * 4);
        int i = 0;
        while (i < bytes.length) {
            int value = bytes[i] & 0xFF;
            result.append(hexChar(value / 16));
            result.append(hexChar(value % 16));
            i++;
            if (i % BYTES_PER_LINE == 0) {
                result.append('\n');
            } else if (i % HALF_BYTES_PER_LINE == 0) {
                result.append("   ");
            } else {
                result.append(' ');
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
    private static char hexChar(int value) {
        return (char) (value < 10 ? ('0' + value) : ('a' + (value - 10)));
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
