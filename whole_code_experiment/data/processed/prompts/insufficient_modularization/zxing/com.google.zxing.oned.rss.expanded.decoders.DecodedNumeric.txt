# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

final class DecodedNumeric extends DecodedObject {
    private final int firstDigit;
    private final int secondDigit;
    static final int FNC1 = 10;
    DecodedNumeric(int newPosition, int firstDigit, int secondDigit) throws FormatException {
        super(newPosition);
        if (firstDigit < 0 || firstDigit > 10 || secondDigit < 0 || secondDigit > 10) {
            throw FormatException.getFormatInstance();
        }
        this.firstDigit = firstDigit;
        this.secondDigit = secondDigit;
    }
    int getFirstDigit() {
        return this.firstDigit;
    }
    int getSecondDigit() {
        return this.secondDigit;
    }
    int getValue() {
        return this.firstDigit * 10 + this.secondDigit;
    }
    boolean isFirstDigitFNC1() {
        return this.firstDigit == FNC1;
    }
    boolean isSecondDigitFNC1() {
        return this.secondDigit == FNC1;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
