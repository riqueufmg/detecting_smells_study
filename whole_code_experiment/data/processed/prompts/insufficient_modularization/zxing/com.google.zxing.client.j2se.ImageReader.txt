# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.j2se;
public final class ImageReader {
    private static final String BASE64TOKEN = "base64,";
    private ImageReader() {
    }
    public static BufferedImage readImage(URI uri) throws IOException {
        if ("data".equals(uri.getScheme())) {
            return readDataURIImage(uri);
        }
        BufferedImage result;
        try {
            result = ImageIO.read(uri.toURL());
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {
            throw new IOException("Resource not found: " + uri, iae);
        }
        if (result == null) {
            throw new IOException("Could not load " + uri);
        }
        return result;
    }
    public static BufferedImage readDataURIImage(URI uri) throws IOException {
        String uriString = uri.getSchemeSpecificPart();
        if (!uriString.startsWith("image/")) {
            throw new IOException("Unsupported data URI MIME type");
        }
        int base64Start = uriString.indexOf(BASE64TOKEN);
        if (base64Start < 0) {
            throw new IOException("Unsupported data URI encoding");
        }
        String base64Data = uriString.substring(base64Start + BASE64TOKEN.length());
        byte[] imageBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(base64Data);
        return ImageIO.read(new ByteArrayInputStream(imageBytes));
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
