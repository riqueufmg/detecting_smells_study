# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.share;
final class BookmarkAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
    private final Context context;
    private final List<String[]> titleURLs;
    BookmarkAdapter(Context context, List<String[]> titleURLs) {
        this.context = context;
        this.titleURLs = titleURLs;
    }
    public int getCount() {
        return titleURLs.size();
    }
    public Object getItem(int index) {
        return titleURLs.get(index);
    }
    public long getItemId(int index) {
        return index;
    }
    public View getView(int index, View view, ViewGroup viewGroup) {
        View layout;
        if (view instanceof LinearLayout) {
            layout = view;
        } else {
            LayoutInflater factory = LayoutInflater.from(context);
            layout = factory.inflate(R.layout.bookmark_picker_list_item, viewGroup, false);
        }
        String[] titleURL = titleURLs.get(index);
        ((TextView) layout.findViewById(R.id.bookmark_title)).setText(titleURL[0]);
        ((TextView) layout.findViewById(R.id.bookmark_url)).setText(titleURL[1]);
        return layout;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
