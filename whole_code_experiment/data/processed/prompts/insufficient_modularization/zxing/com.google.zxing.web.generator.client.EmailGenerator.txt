# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.web.generator.client;
public final class EmailGenerator implements GeneratorSource {
    private Grid table;
    private final TextBox email = new TextBox();
    public EmailGenerator(ChangeHandler handler, KeyPressHandler keyListener) {
        email.addStyleName(StylesDefs.INPUT_FIELD_REQUIRED);
        email.addChangeHandler(handler);
        email.addKeyPressHandler(keyListener);
    }
    public String getName() {
        return "Email address";
    }
    public String getText() throws GeneratorException {
        return "mailto:" + getEmailField();
    }
    private String getEmailField() throws GeneratorException {
        String input = email.getText();
        if (input.isEmpty()) {
            throw new GeneratorException("Email must be present.");
        }
        Validators.validateEmail(input);
        return input;
    }
    public Grid getWidget() {
        if (table != null) {
            return table;
        }
        table = new Grid(1, 2);
        table.setText(0, 0, "Address");
        table.setWidget(0, 1, email);
        return table;
    }
    public void validate(Widget widget) throws GeneratorException {
        if (widget == email) {
            getEmailField();
        }
    }
    public void setFocus() {
        email.setFocus(true);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
