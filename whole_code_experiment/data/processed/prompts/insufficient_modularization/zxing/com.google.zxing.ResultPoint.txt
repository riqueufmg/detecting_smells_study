# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing;
public class ResultPoint {
    private final float x;
    private final float y;
    public ResultPoint(float x, float y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    public final float getX() {
        return x;
    }
    public final float getY() {
        return y;
    }
    public final boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (other instanceof ResultPoint) {
            ResultPoint otherPoint = (ResultPoint) other;
            return x == otherPoint.x && y == otherPoint.y;
        }
        return false;
    }
    public final int hashCode() {
        return 31 * Float.floatToIntBits(x) + Float.floatToIntBits(y);
    }
    public final String toString() {
        return "(" + x + ',' + y + ')';
    }
    public static void orderBestPatterns(ResultPoint[] patterns) {
        float zeroOneDistance = distance(patterns[0], patterns[1]);
        float oneTwoDistance = distance(patterns[1], patterns[2]);
        float zeroTwoDistance = distance(patterns[0], patterns[2]);
        ResultPoint pointA;
        ResultPoint pointB;
        ResultPoint pointC;
        if (oneTwoDistance >= zeroOneDistance && oneTwoDistance >= zeroTwoDistance) {
            pointB = patterns[0];
            pointA = patterns[1];
            pointC = patterns[2];
        } else if (zeroTwoDistance >= oneTwoDistance && zeroTwoDistance >= zeroOneDistance) {
            pointB = patterns[1];
            pointA = patterns[0];
            pointC = patterns[2];
        } else {
            pointB = patterns[2];
            pointA = patterns[0];
            pointC = patterns[1];
        }
        if (crossProductZ(pointA, pointB, pointC) < 0.0f) {
            ResultPoint temp = pointA;
            pointA = pointC;
            pointC = temp;
        }
        patterns[0] = pointA;
        patterns[1] = pointB;
        patterns[2] = pointC;
    }
    public static float distance(ResultPoint pattern1, ResultPoint pattern2) {
        return MathUtils.distance(pattern1.x, pattern1.y, pattern2.x, pattern2.y);
    }
    private static float crossProductZ(ResultPoint pointA, ResultPoint pointB, ResultPoint pointC) {
        float bX = pointB.x;
        float bY = pointB.y;
        return ((pointC.x - bX) * (pointA.y - bY)) - ((pointC.y - bY) * (pointA.x - bX));
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
