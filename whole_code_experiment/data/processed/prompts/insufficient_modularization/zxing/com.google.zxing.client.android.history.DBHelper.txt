# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.history;
final class DBHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
    private static final int DB_VERSION = 5;
    private static final String DB_NAME = "barcode_scanner_history.db";
    static final String TABLE_NAME = "history";
    static final String ID_COL = "id";
    static final String TEXT_COL = "text";
    static final String FORMAT_COL = "format";
    static final String DISPLAY_COL = "display";
    static final String TIMESTAMP_COL = "timestamp";
    static final String DETAILS_COL = "details";
    DBHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DB_NAME, null, DB_VERSION);
    }
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase) {
        sqLiteDatabase.execSQL("CREATE TABLE " + TABLE_NAME + " (" + ID_COL + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, " + TEXT_COL + " TEXT, " + FORMAT_COL + " TEXT, " + DISPLAY_COL + " TEXT, " + TIMESTAMP_COL + " INTEGER, " + DETAILS_COL + " TEXT);");
    }
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
        sqLiteDatabase.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS " + TABLE_NAME);
        onCreate(sqLiteDatabase);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
