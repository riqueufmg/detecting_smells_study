# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android;
final class ScanFromWebPageManager {
    private static final CharSequence CODE_PLACEHOLDER = "{CODE}";
    private static final CharSequence RAW_CODE_PLACEHOLDER = "{RAWCODE}";
    private static final CharSequence META_PLACEHOLDER = "{META}";
    private static final CharSequence FORMAT_PLACEHOLDER = "{FORMAT}";
    private static final CharSequence TYPE_PLACEHOLDER = "{TYPE}";
    private static final String RETURN_URL_PARAM = "ret";
    private static final String RAW_PARAM = "raw";
    private final String returnUrlTemplate;
    private final boolean returnRaw;
    ScanFromWebPageManager(Uri inputUri) {
        returnUrlTemplate = inputUri.getQueryParameter(RETURN_URL_PARAM);
        returnRaw = inputUri.getQueryParameter(RAW_PARAM) != null;
    }
    boolean isScanFromWebPage() {
        return returnUrlTemplate != null;
    }
    String buildReplyURL(Result rawResult, ResultHandler resultHandler) {
        String result = returnUrlTemplate;
        result = replace(CODE_PLACEHOLDER, returnRaw ? rawResult.getText() : resultHandler.getDisplayContents(), result);
        result = replace(RAW_CODE_PLACEHOLDER, rawResult.getText(), result);
        result = replace(FORMAT_PLACEHOLDER, rawResult.getBarcodeFormat().toString(), result);
        result = replace(TYPE_PLACEHOLDER, resultHandler.getType().toString(), result);
        result = replace(META_PLACEHOLDER, String.valueOf(rawResult.getResultMetadata()), result);
        return result;
    }
    private static String replace(CharSequence placeholder, CharSequence with, String pattern) {
        CharSequence escapedWith = with == null ? "" : with;
        try {
            escapedWith = URLEncoder.encode(escapedWith.toString(), "UTF-8");
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        }
        return pattern.replace(placeholder, escapedWith);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
