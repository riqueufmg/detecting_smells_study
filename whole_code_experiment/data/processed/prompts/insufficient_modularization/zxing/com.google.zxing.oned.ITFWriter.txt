# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.oned;
public final class ITFWriter extends OneDimensionalCodeWriter {
    private static final int[] START_PATTERN = { 1, 1, 1, 1 };
    private static final int[] END_PATTERN = { 3, 1, 1 };
    private static final int W = 3;
    private static final int N = 1;
    private static final int[][] PATTERNS = { { N, N, W, W, N }, { W, N, N, N, W }, { N, W, N, N, W }, { W, W, N, N, N }, { N, N, W, N, W }, { W, N, W, N, N }, { N, W, W, N, N }, { N, N, N, W, W }, { W, N, N, W, N }, { N, W, N, W, N } };
    protected Collection<BarcodeFormat> getSupportedWriteFormats() {
        return Collections.singleton(BarcodeFormat.ITF);
    }
    public boolean[] encode(String contents) {
        int length = contents.length();
        if (length % 2 != 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The length of the input should be even");
        }
        if (length > 80) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Requested contents should be less than 80 digits long, but got " + length);
        }
        checkNumeric(contents);
        boolean[] result = new boolean[9 + 9 * length];
        int pos = appendPattern(result, 0, START_PATTERN, true);
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i += 2) {
            int one = Character.digit(contents.charAt(i), 10);
            int two = Character.digit(contents.charAt(i + 1), 10);
            int[] encoding = new int[10];
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                encoding[2 * j] = PATTERNS[one][j];
                encoding[2 * j + 1] = PATTERNS[two][j];
            }
            pos += appendPattern(result, pos, encoding, true);
        }
        appendPattern(result, pos, END_PATTERN, true);
        return result;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
