# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.result;
public final class TelResultHandler extends ResultHandler {
    private static final int[] buttons = { R.string.button_dial, R.string.button_add_contact };
    public TelResultHandler(Activity activity, ParsedResult result) {
        super(activity, result);
    }
    public int getButtonCount() {
        return buttons.length;
    }
    public int getButtonText(int index) {
        return buttons[index];
    }
    public void handleButtonPress(int index) {
        TelParsedResult telResult = (TelParsedResult) getResult();
        switch(index) {
            case 0:
                dialPhoneFromUri(telResult.getTelURI());
                getActivity().finish();
                break;
            case 1:
                String[] numbers = new String[1];
                numbers[0] = telResult.getNumber();
                addPhoneOnlyContact(numbers, null);
                break;
        }
    }
    public CharSequence getDisplayContents() {
        String contents = getResult().getDisplayResult();
        contents = contents.replace("\r", "");
        return formatPhone(contents);
    }
    public int getDisplayTitle() {
        return R.string.result_tel;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
