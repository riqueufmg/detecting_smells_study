# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.share;
public final class AppPickerActivity extends ListActivity {
    private AsyncTask<Object, Object, List<AppInfo>> backgroundTask;
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        backgroundTask = new LoadPackagesAsyncTask(this);
        backgroundTask.executeOnExecutor(AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR);
    }
    protected void onPause() {
        AsyncTask<?, ?, ?> task = backgroundTask;
        if (task != null) {
            task.cancel(true);
            backgroundTask = null;
        }
        super.onPause();
    }
    protected void onListItemClick(ListView l, View view, int position, long id) {
        Adapter adapter = getListAdapter();
        if (position >= 0 && position < adapter.getCount()) {
            String packageName = ((AppInfo) adapter.getItem(position)).getPackageName();
            Intent intent = new Intent();
            intent.addFlags(Intents.FLAG_NEW_DOC);
            intent.putExtra("url", "market://details?id=" + packageName);
            setResult(RESULT_OK, intent);
        } else {
            setResult(RESULT_CANCELED);
        }
        finish();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
