# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.android.share;
public final class BookmarkPickerActivity extends ListActivity {
    private static final String TAG = BookmarkPickerActivity.class.getSimpleName();
    private static final String[] BOOKMARK_PROJECTION = { "title", "url" };
    private static final Uri BOOKMARKS_URI = Uri.parse("content://browser/bookmarks");
    private static final String BOOKMARK_SELECTION = "bookmark = 1 AND url IS NOT NULL";
    private final List<String[]> titleURLs = new ArrayList<>();
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        titleURLs.clear();
        try (Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(BOOKMARKS_URI, BOOKMARK_PROJECTION, BOOKMARK_SELECTION, null, null)) {
            if (cursor == null) {
                Log.w(TAG, "No cursor returned for bookmark query");
                finish();
                return;
            }
            while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
                titleURLs.add(new String[] { cursor.getString(0), cursor.getString(1) });
            }
        }
        setListAdapter(new BookmarkAdapter(this, titleURLs));
    }
    protected void onListItemClick(ListView l, View view, int position, long id) {
        String[] titleURL = titleURLs.get(position);
        Intent intent = new Intent();
        intent.addFlags(Intents.FLAG_NEW_DOC);
        intent.putExtra("title", titleURL[0]);
        intent.putExtra("url", titleURL[1]);
        setResult(RESULT_OK, intent);
        finish();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
