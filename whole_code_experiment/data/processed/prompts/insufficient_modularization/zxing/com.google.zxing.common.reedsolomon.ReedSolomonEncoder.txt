# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon;
public final class ReedSolomonEncoder {
    private final GenericGF field;
    private final List<GenericGFPoly> cachedGenerators;
    public ReedSolomonEncoder(GenericGF field) {
        this.field = field;
        this.cachedGenerators = new ArrayList<>();
        cachedGenerators.add(new GenericGFPoly(field, new int[] { 1 }));
    }
    private GenericGFPoly buildGenerator(int degree) {
        if (degree >= cachedGenerators.size()) {
            GenericGFPoly lastGenerator = cachedGenerators.get(cachedGenerators.size() - 1);
            for (int d = cachedGenerators.size(); d <= degree; d++) {
                GenericGFPoly nextGenerator = lastGenerator.multiply(new GenericGFPoly(field, new int[] { 1, field.exp(d - 1 + field.getGeneratorBase()) }));
                cachedGenerators.add(nextGenerator);
                lastGenerator = nextGenerator;
            }
        }
        return cachedGenerators.get(degree);
    }
    public void encode(int[] toEncode, int ecBytes) {
        if (ecBytes == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("No error correction bytes");
        }
        int dataBytes = toEncode.length - ecBytes;
        if (dataBytes <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("No data bytes provided");
        }
        GenericGFPoly generator = buildGenerator(ecBytes);
        int[] infoCoefficients = new int[dataBytes];
        System.arraycopy(toEncode, 0, infoCoefficients, 0, dataBytes);
        GenericGFPoly info = new GenericGFPoly(field, infoCoefficients);
        info = info.multiplyByMonomial(ecBytes, 1);
        GenericGFPoly remainder = info.divide(generator)[1];
        int[] coefficients = remainder.getCoefficients();
        int numZeroCoefficients = ecBytes - coefficients.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < numZeroCoefficients; i++) {
            toEncode[dataBytes + i] = 0;
        }
        System.arraycopy(coefficients, 0, toEncode, dataBytes + numZeroCoefficients, coefficients.length);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
