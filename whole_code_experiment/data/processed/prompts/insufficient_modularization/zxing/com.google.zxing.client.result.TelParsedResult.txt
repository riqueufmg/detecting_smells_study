# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.client.result;
public final class TelParsedResult extends ParsedResult {
    private final String number;
    private final String telURI;
    private final String title;
    public TelParsedResult(String number, String telURI, String title) {
        super(ParsedResultType.TEL);
        this.number = number;
        this.telURI = telURI;
        this.title = title;
    }
    public String getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
    public String getTelURI() {
        return telURI;
    }
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
    public String getDisplayResult() {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(20);
        maybeAppend(number, result);
        maybeAppend(title, result);
        return result.toString();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
