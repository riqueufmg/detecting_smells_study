# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder;
final class Codeword {
    private static final int BARCODE_ROW_UNKNOWN = -1;
    private final int startX;
    private final int endX;
    private final int bucket;
    private final int value;
    private int rowNumber = BARCODE_ROW_UNKNOWN;
    Codeword(int startX, int endX, int bucket, int value) {
        this.startX = startX;
        this.endX = endX;
        this.bucket = bucket;
        this.value = value;
    }
    boolean hasValidRowNumber() {
        return isValidRowNumber(rowNumber);
    }
    boolean isValidRowNumber(int rowNumber) {
        return rowNumber != BARCODE_ROW_UNKNOWN && bucket == (rowNumber % 3) * 3;
    }
    void setRowNumberAsRowIndicatorColumn() {
        rowNumber = (value / 30) * 3 + bucket / 3;
    }
    int getWidth() {
        return endX - startX;
    }
    int getStartX() {
        return startX;
    }
    int getEndX() {
        return endX;
    }
    int getBucket() {
        return bucket;
    }
    int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
    int getRowNumber() {
        return rowNumber;
    }
    void setRowNumber(int rowNumber) {
        this.rowNumber = rowNumber;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return rowNumber + "|" + value;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
