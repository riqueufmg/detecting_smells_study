# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder;
public final class BarcodeMatrix {
    private final BarcodeRow[] matrix;
    private int currentRow;
    private final int height;
    private final int width;
    BarcodeMatrix(int height, int width) {
        matrix = new BarcodeRow[height];
        for (int i = 0, matrixLength = matrix.length; i < matrixLength; i++) {
            matrix[i] = new BarcodeRow((width + 4) * 17 + 1);
        }
        this.width = width * 17;
        this.height = height;
        this.currentRow = -1;
    }
    void set(int x, int y, byte value) {
        matrix[y].set(x, value);
    }
    void startRow() {
        ++currentRow;
    }
    BarcodeRow getCurrentRow() {
        return matrix[currentRow];
    }
    public byte[][] getMatrix() {
        return getScaledMatrix(1, 1);
    }
    public byte[][] getScaledMatrix(int xScale, int yScale) {
        byte[][] matrixOut = new byte[height * yScale][width * xScale];
        int yMax = height * yScale;
        for (int i = 0; i < yMax; i++) {
            matrixOut[yMax - i - 1] = matrix[i / yScale].getScaledRow(xScale);
        }
        return matrixOut;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
