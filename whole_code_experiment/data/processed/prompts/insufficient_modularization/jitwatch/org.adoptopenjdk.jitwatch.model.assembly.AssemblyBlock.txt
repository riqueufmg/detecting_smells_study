# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly;
public class AssemblyBlock {
    private String title;
    private List<AssemblyInstruction> instructions = new ArrayList<>();
    public AssemblyBlock() {
    }
    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
    public void addInstruction(AssemblyInstruction instr) {
        instructions.add(instr);
    }
    public void replaceLastInstruction(AssemblyInstruction instr) {
        instructions.set(instructions.size() - 1, instr);
    }
    public List<AssemblyInstruction> getInstructions() {
        return instructions;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return toString(0);
    }
    public String toString(int maxAnnotationWidth) {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        if (title != null) {
            builder.append(StringUtil.repeat(C_SPACE, maxAnnotationWidth));
            builder.append(title).append(S_NEWLINE);
        }
        for (AssemblyInstruction instruction : instructions) {
            builder.append(instruction.toString(maxAnnotationWidth, false)).append(S_NEWLINE);
        }
        return builder.toString();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
