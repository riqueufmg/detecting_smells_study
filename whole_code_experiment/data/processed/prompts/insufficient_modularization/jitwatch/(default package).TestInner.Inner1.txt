# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
public class TestInner {
    public TestInner() {
        System.out.println("TestInner()");
        a();
        new Inner1();
    }
    public void a() {
        System.out.println("TestInner.a()");
    }
    class Inner1 {
        public Inner1() {
            System.out.println("TestInner.Inner1()");
            b();
            new Inner2();
        }
        public void b() {
            System.out.println("TestInner.Inner1.b()");
        }
        class Inner2 {
            public Inner2() {
                System.out.println("TestInner.Inner1.Inner2()");
                c();
            }
            public void c() {
                System.out.println("TestInner.Inner1.Inner2.c()");
            }
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new TestInner();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
