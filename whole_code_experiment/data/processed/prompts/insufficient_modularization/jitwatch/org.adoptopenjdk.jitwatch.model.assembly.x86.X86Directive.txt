# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.x86;
public enum X86Directive {
    DB(".db", "db"),
    DW(".dw", "dw"),
    DD(".dd", "dd"),
    DQ(".dq", "dq"),
    BYTE(".byte"),
    WORD(".word"),
    LONG(".long"),
    QUAD(".quad"),
    ASCII(".ascii"),
    ASCIZ(".asciz"),
    STRING(".string"),
    TEXT(".text"),
    DATA(".data"),
    BSS(".bss"),
    SECTION(".section"),
    GLOBAL(".global", ".globl"),
    ALIGN(".align"),
    EQU(".equ"),
    SET(".set"),
    EXTERN(".extern"),
    TYPE(".type"),
    SIZE(".size"),
    FILE(".file"),
    LOC(".loc"),
    CFI(".cfi");
    private final String[] tokens;
    X86Directive(String... tokens) {
        this.tokens = tokens;
    }
    public static boolean isDirective(String line) {
        if (line == null || line.trim().isEmpty())
            return false;
        String trimmed = line.trim();
        for (X86Directive directive : values()) {
            for (String token : directive.tokens) {
                if (trimmed.startsWith(token + " ") || trimmed.equals(token)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
