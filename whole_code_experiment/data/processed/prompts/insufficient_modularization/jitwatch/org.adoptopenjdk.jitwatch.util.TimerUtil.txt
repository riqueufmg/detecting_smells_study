# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util;
public class TimerUtil {
    private static Map<String, Long> timestampMap = new HashMap<>();
    private static long lastNow = 0;
    public static void timerStart(String key) {
        long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
        timestampMap.put(key, now);
        long delta = now - lastNow;
        if (lastNow != 0) {
            System.out.println(now + " (+" + delta + ") starting " + key);
        } else {
            System.out.println(now + " starting " + key);
        }
        lastNow = now;
    }
    public static void timerEnd(String key) {
        if (timestampMap.containsKey(key)) {
            long start = timestampMap.get(key);
            long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println(key + ": " + (now - start) + "ms");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No start time found for " + key);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
