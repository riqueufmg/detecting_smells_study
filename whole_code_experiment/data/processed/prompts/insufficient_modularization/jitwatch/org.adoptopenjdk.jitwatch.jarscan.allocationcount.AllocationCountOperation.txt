# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount;
public class AllocationCountOperation implements IJarScanOperation {
    private InstructionAllocCountMap opcodeAllocCountMap;
    private int limitPerAllocOpcode;
    public AllocationCountOperation(int limit) {
        opcodeAllocCountMap = new InstructionAllocCountMap();
        this.limitPerAllocOpcode = limit;
    }
    public String getReport() {
        return opcodeAllocCountMap.toString(limitPerAllocOpcode);
    }
    private void count(Opcode opcode, String type) {
        opcodeAllocCountMap.count(opcode, type);
    }
    public void processInstructions(String className, MemberBytecode memberBytecode) {
        List<BytecodeInstruction> instructions = memberBytecode.getInstructions();
        for (BytecodeInstruction instruction : instructions) {
            Opcode opcode = instruction.getOpcode();
            switch(opcode) {
                case NEWARRAY:
                    {
                        List<IBytecodeParam> params = instruction.getParameters();
                        String type = params.get(0).toString();
                        count(opcode, type);
                    }
                    break;
                case ANEWARRAY:
                case NEW:
                case MULTIANEWARRAY:
                    {
                        String comment = instruction.getComment();
                        String type = comment.substring("// class ".length(), comment.length());
                        type = type.replace(S_DOUBLE_QUOTE, S_EMPTY).replace(S_SLASH, S_DOT);
                        count(opcode, type);
                    }
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
