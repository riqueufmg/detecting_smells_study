# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm;
public enum ARMRegisterType {
    ARM64_GENERAL("64-bit ARM register", "x\\d+"),
    ARM64_32BIT("32-bit ARM register", "w\\d+"),
    ARM64_VECTOR("ARM vector register", "v\\d+"),
    ARM64_SIMD_B("ARM SIMD byte register", "b\\d+"),
    ARM64_SIMD_H("ARM SIMD half-word register", "h\\d+"),
    ARM64_SIMD_S("ARM SIMD single-word register", "s\\d+"),
    ARM64_SIMD_D("ARM SIMD double-word register", "d\\d+"),
    ARM64_SIMD_Q("ARM SIMD quad-word register", "q\\d+"),
    ARM32_GENERAL("ARM general purpose register", "r\\d+"),
    ARM_SP("stack pointer register", "sp"),
    ARM_LR("link register", "lr"),
    ARM_PC("program counter register", "pc"),
    ARM_ZR("zero register", "(xzr|wzr)"),
    ARM_DEFAULT("ARM register", ".*");
    private final String description;
    private final String pattern;
    ARMRegisterType(String description, String pattern) {
        this.description = description;
        this.pattern = pattern;
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
    public boolean matches(String regName) {
        return regName != null && regName.matches(pattern);
    }
    public static ARMRegisterType fromRegisterName(String regName) {
        if (regName == null) {
            return ARM_DEFAULT;
        }
        for (ARMRegisterType type : values()) {
            if (type.matches(regName)) {
                return type;
            }
        }
        return ARM_DEFAULT;
    }
    public static String getSpecialPurpose(String regName) {
        if (regName == null) {
            return "";
        }
        if (regName.endsWith("fp")) {
            return " (frame pointer)";
        }
        return "";
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
