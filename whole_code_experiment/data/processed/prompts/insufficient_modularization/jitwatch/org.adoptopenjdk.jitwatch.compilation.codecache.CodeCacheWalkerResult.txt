# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation.codecache;
public class CodeCacheWalkerResult {
    private List<CodeCacheEvent> events;
    private long lowestAddress;
    private long highestAddress;
    public CodeCacheWalkerResult() {
        events = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    public void reset() {
        events.clear();
        lowestAddress = 0;
        highestAddress = 0;
    }
    public void addEvent(CodeCacheEvent event) {
        long nativeCodeStart = event.getNativeAddress();
        long nativeCodeEnd = nativeCodeStart + event.getNativeCodeSize();
        if (events.isEmpty()) {
            lowestAddress = nativeCodeStart;
            highestAddress = nativeCodeEnd;
        } else {
            lowestAddress = Math.min(nativeCodeStart, lowestAddress);
            highestAddress = Math.max(nativeCodeEnd, highestAddress);
        }
        events.add(event);
    }
    public List<CodeCacheEvent> getEvents() {
        Collections.sort(events, new Comparator<CodeCacheEvent>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(CodeCacheEvent o1, CodeCacheEvent o2) {
                return Long.compare(o1.getStamp(), o2.getStamp());
            }
        });
        return events;
    }
    public long getLowestAddress() {
        return lowestAddress;
    }
    public long getHighestAddress() {
        return highestAddress;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "CodeCacheWalkerResult [events=" + events + ", lowestAddress=" + lowestAddress + ", highestAddress=" + highestAddress + "]";
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
