# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.toplist;
public class MostUsedIntrinsicsTopListVisitable extends AbstractTopListVisitable {
    private final Map<String, Integer> intrinsicCountMap;
    public MostUsedIntrinsicsTopListVisitable(IReadOnlyJITDataModel model, boolean sortHighToLow) {
        super(model, sortHighToLow);
        intrinsicCountMap = new HashMap<>();
    }
    public void visit(IMetaMember metaMember) {
        if (metaMember.isCompiled()) {
            IntrinsicFinder finder = new IntrinsicFinder();
            Map<String, String> intrinsicMap = finder.findIntrinsics(metaMember);
            for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : intrinsicMap.entrySet()) {
                String iMapping = entry.getKey() + " => " + entry.getValue();
                int count = 0;
                if (intrinsicCountMap.containsKey(iMapping)) {
                    count = intrinsicCountMap.get(iMapping);
                }
                intrinsicCountMap.put(iMapping, count + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    public void postProcess() {
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : intrinsicCountMap.entrySet()) {
            topList.add(new StringTopListScore(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue().longValue()));
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
