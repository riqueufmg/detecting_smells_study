# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.cell;
public class LinkedBCICell extends TableCell<IReportRowBean, Report> {
    private Button btnTriView;
    private static IStageAccessProxy triViewAccessor;
    public static void setTriViewAccessor(IStageAccessProxy triViewAccessor) {
        LinkedBCICell.triViewAccessor = triViewAccessor;
    }
    public LinkedBCICell() {
        btnTriView = new Button("View");
        setGraphic(btnTriView);
    }
    protected void updateItem(final Report report, boolean empty) {
        if (report != null && report.getCaller() != null) {
            final IMetaMember member = report.getCaller();
            btnTriView.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
                @Override
                public void handle(ActionEvent e) {
                    if (report.getCompilationIndex() != -1) {
                        member.setSelectedCompilation(report.getCompilationIndex());
                    }
                    triViewAccessor.openTriView(member, report.getBytecodeOffset());
                }
            });
            btnTriView.setText("View BCI " + report.getBytecodeOffset());
            btnTriView.setVisible(true);
        } else {
            btnTriView.setVisible(false);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
