# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
public class InlineSmallCode {
    private class Point {
        private int x, y;
        public Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
        public int getX() {
            return x;
        }
        public int getY() {
            return y;
        }
    }
    public InlineSmallCode() {
        System.out.println(sumOfSquares(200_000));
    }
    private long sumOfSquares(int limit) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
            Point p = new Point(i, i);
            logPoint(p);
            sum += p.getX() * p.getY();
        }
        return sum;
    }
    private void logPoint(Point p) {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        builder.append("Point(").append(p.getX()).append(",").append(p.getY()).append(")");
        System.out.println(builder.toString());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new InlineSmallCode();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
