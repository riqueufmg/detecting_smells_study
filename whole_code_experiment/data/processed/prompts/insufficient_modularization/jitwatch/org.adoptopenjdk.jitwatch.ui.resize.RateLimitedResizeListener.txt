# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.resize;
public class RateLimitedResizeListener implements ChangeListener<Number> {
    private long lastResizeRedraw;
    private boolean delayedRedrawQueued = false;
    private boolean delayedRedrawRequired = false;
    private IRedrawable redrawable;
    private long minIntervalMillis;
    public RateLimitedResizeListener(IRedrawable redrawable, long minIntervalMillis) {
        this.redrawable = redrawable;
        this.minIntervalMillis = minIntervalMillis;
    }
    public void changed(ObservableValue<? extends Number> property, Number from, Number to) {
        if (to.doubleValue() <= 1.0) {
            return;
        }
        long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
        if (now - lastResizeRedraw > minIntervalMillis) {
            redrawable.redraw();
            delayedRedrawRequired = false;
            lastResizeRedraw = now;
        } else {
            if (!delayedRedrawQueued) {
                delayedRedrawQueued = true;
                delayedRedrawRequired = true;
                new Thread(new Runnable() {
                    @Override
                    public void // off UI thread
                    run() {
                        try {
                            Thread.sleep(1000);
                            Platform.runLater(new Runnable() {
                                @Override
                                public void // on UI thread
                                run() {
                                    if (delayedRedrawRequired) {
                                        redrawable.redraw();
                                        delayedRedrawRequired = false;
                                    }
                                    delayedRedrawQueued = false;
                                }
                            });
                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        }
                    }
                }).start();
            }
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
