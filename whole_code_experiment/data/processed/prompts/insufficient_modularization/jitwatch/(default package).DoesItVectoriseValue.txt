# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
public class DoesItVectoriseValue
{
    public DoesItVectoriseValue()
    {
        int[] array = new int[1024];

        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++)
        {
            incrementArray(array, 1);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
        {
            System.out.println(array[i]);
        }
    }

    public void incrementArray(int[] array, int constant)
    {
        int length = array.length;

        for (Cursor c = Cursor.of(length); c.canAdvance(); c = c.advance())
        {
            array[c.position] += constant;
        }
    }

    public value record Cursor(int position, int length)
    {
        public Cursor {
            if (length < 0 || position > length)
            {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            }
        }

        public static Cursor of(int length)
        {
            return new Cursor(0, length);
        }

        public boolean canAdvance()
        {
            return position < length;
        }

        public Cursor advance()
        {
            return new Cursor(position + 1, length);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        new DoesItVectoriseValue();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
