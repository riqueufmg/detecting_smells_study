# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow;
public class HotThrowResult {
    private IMetaMember member;
    private int bci;
    private String exceptionType;
    private boolean preallocated;
    public HotThrowResult(IMetaMember member, int bci, String exceptionType, boolean preallocated) {
        super();
        this.member = member;
        this.bci = bci;
        this.exceptionType = exceptionType;
        this.preallocated = preallocated;
    }
    public IMetaMember getMember() {
        return member;
    }
    public int getBci() {
        return bci;
    }
    public String getExceptionType() {
        return exceptionType;
    }
    public boolean isPreallocated() {
        return preallocated;
    }
    public int hashCode() {
        final int prime = 31;
        int result = 1;
        result = prime * result + bci;
        result = prime * result + ((exceptionType == null) ? 0 : exceptionType.hashCode());
        result = prime * result + ((member == null) ? 0 : member.hashCode());
        result = prime * result + (preallocated ? 1231 : 1237);
        return result;
    }
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj)
            return true;
        if (obj == null)
            return false;
        if (getClass() != obj.getClass())
            return false;
        HotThrowResult other = (HotThrowResult) obj;
        if (bci != other.bci)
            return false;
        if (exceptionType == null) {
            if (other.exceptionType != null)
                return false;
        } else if (!exceptionType.equals(other.exceptionType))
            return false;
        if (member == null) {
            if (other.member != null)
                return false;
        } else if (!member.equals(other.member))
            return false;
        if (preallocated != other.preallocated)
            return false;
        return true;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
