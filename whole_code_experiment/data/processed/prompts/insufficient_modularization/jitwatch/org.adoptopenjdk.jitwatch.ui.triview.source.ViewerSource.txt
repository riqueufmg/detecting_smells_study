# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source;
public class ViewerSource extends Viewer {
    public ViewerSource(IStageAccessProxy stageAccessProxy, ILineListener lineListener, LineType lineType) {
        super(stageAccessProxy, lineListener, lineType, true);
    }
    public void setContent(String inSource, boolean showLineNumbers, boolean canHighlight) {
        clear();
        String source = inSource;
        isHighlighting = canHighlight;
        if (source == null) {
            source = "Empty";
        }
        originalSource = source;
        source = source.replace(S_TAB, S_DOUBLE_SPACE);
        String[] lines = source.split(S_NEWLINE);
        int maxWidth = Integer.toString(lines.length).length();
        List<Label> labels = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
            String row = lines[i];
            if (showLineNumbers) {
                lines[i] = StringUtil.padLineNumber(i + 1, maxWidth) + S_DOUBLE_SPACE + row;
            }
            lines[i] = lines[i].replace(S_NEWLINE_CR, S_EMPTY);
            InstructionLabel lblInstruction = new InstructionLabel(lines[i]);
            labels.add(lblInstruction);
        }
        setContent(labels);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
