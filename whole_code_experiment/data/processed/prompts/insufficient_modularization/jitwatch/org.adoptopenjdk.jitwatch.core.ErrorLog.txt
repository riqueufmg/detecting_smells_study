# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core;
public class ErrorLog {
    private Map<String, Integer> errorCountMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    public void clear() {
        errorCountMap.clear();
    }
    public void addEntry(String entry) {
        if (errorCountMap.containsKey(entry)) {
            errorCountMap.put(entry, errorCountMap.get(entry) + 1);
        } else {
            errorCountMap.put(entry, 1);
        }
    }
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : errorCountMap.entrySet()) {
            String msg = entry.getKey();
            int count = entry.getValue();
            if (count == 1) {
                builder.append(msg).append(S_NEWLINE);
            } else {
                builder.append(msg).append(S_SPACE).append(S_OPEN_PARENTHESES).append(count).append(S_SPACE).append("times").append(S_CLOSE_PARENTHESES).append(S_NEWLINE);
            }
        }
        return builder.toString();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
