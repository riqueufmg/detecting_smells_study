# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly;
public enum Architecture {
    X86_32, X86_64, ARM_32, ARM_64;
    private static final String ARCH_X86_32 = "i386";
    private static final String ARCH_X86_64 = "i386:x86-64";
    private static final String ARCH_AMD_64 = "amd64";
    private static final String ARCH_ARM_32 = "arm";
    private static final String ARCH_ARM_64 = "arm-64";
    private static final String ARCH_AARCH64 = "aarch64";
    public static Architecture parseFromLogLine(String line) {
        String arch = StringUtil.getSubstringBetween(line, S_APOSTROPHE, S_APOSTROPHE);
        if (arch != null) {
            switch(arch) {
                case ARCH_X86_32:
                    return X86_32;
                case ARCH_X86_64:
                case ARCH_AMD_64:
                    return X86_64;
                case ARCH_ARM_32:
                    return ARM_32;
                case ARCH_ARM_64:
                case ARCH_AARCH64:
                    return ARM_64;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
