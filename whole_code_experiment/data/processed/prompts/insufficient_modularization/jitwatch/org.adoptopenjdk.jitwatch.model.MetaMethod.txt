# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model;
public class MetaMethod extends AbstractMetaMember {
    private String methodToString;
    public MetaMethod(Method method, MetaClass methodClass) {
        super(method.getName());
        this.methodToString = method.toString();
        this.metaClass = methodClass;
        returnType = method.getReturnType();
        paramTypes = Arrays.asList(method.getParameterTypes());
        modifier = method.getModifiers() & Modifier.methodModifiers();
        isVarArgs = method.isVarArgs();
        checkPolymorphicSignature(method);
        if (DEBUG_MEMBER_CREATION) {
            logger.debug("Created MetaMethod: {}", toString());
        }
    }
    public void setParamTypes(List<Class<?>> types) {
        this.paramTypes = types;
    }
    public void setReturnType(Class<?> returnType) {
        this.returnType = returnType;
    }
    public String toString() {
        String methodSigWithoutThrows = methodToString;
        int closingParentheses = methodSigWithoutThrows.indexOf(')');
        if (closingParentheses != methodSigWithoutThrows.length() - 1) {
            methodSigWithoutThrows = methodSigWithoutThrows.substring(0, closingParentheses + 1);
        }
        return methodSigWithoutThrows;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
