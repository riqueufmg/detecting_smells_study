# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
public class MegamorphicBypass {
    public interface Coin {
        void deposit();
    }
    public class Nickel implements Coin {
        public void deposit() {
            moneyBox += 5;
        }
    }
    public class Dime implements Coin {
        public void deposit() {
            moneyBox += 10;
        }
    }
    public class Quarter implements Coin {
        public void deposit() {
            moneyBox += 25;
        }
    }
    public static int moneyBox = 0;
    public MegamorphicBypass() {
        Coin nickel = new Nickel();
        Coin dime = new Dime();
        Coin quarter = new Quarter();
        Coin coin = null;
        final int maxImplementations = 3;
        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
            switch(i % maxImplementations) {
                case 0:
                    coin = nickel;
                    break;
                case 1:
                    coin = dime;
                    break;
                case 2:
                    coin = quarter;
                    break;
            }
            if (coin instanceof Nickel) {
                coin.deposit();
            } else {
                coin.deposit();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("moneyBox:" + moneyBox);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new MegamorphicBypass();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
