# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
public class InliningChains {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new InliningChains();
    }
    public InliningChains() {
        long count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
            count = chainA1(count);
            count = chainB1(count);
        }
        System.out.println("InliningChains: " + count);
    }
    private long chainA1(long count) {
        return 1 + chainA2(count);
    }
    private long chainA2(long count) {
        return 2 + chainA3(count);
    }
    private long chainA3(long count) {
        return 3 + chainA4(count);
    }
    private long chainA4(long count) {
        return bigMethod(count, 4);
    }
    private long chainB1(long count) {
        return chainB2(count) - 1;
    }
    private long chainB2(long count) {
        return chainB3(count) - 2;
    }
    private long chainB3(long count) {
        return count - 3;
    }
    private long bigMethod(long count, int i) {
        long a, b, c, d, e, f, g;
        a = count;
        b = count;
        c = count;
        d = count;
        e = count;
        f = count;
        g = count;
        a += i;
        b += i;
        c += i;
        d += i;
        e += i;
        f += i;
        g += i;
        a += 1;
        b += 2;
        c += 3;
        d += 4;
        e += 5;
        f += 6;
        g += 7;
        a += i;
        b += i;
        c += i;
        d += i;
        e += i;
        f += i;
        g += i;
        a -= 7;
        b -= 6;
        c -= 5;
        d -= 4;
        e -= 3;
        f -= 2;
        g -= 1;
        a++;
        b++;
        c++;
        d++;
        e++;
        f++;
        g++;
        a /= 2;
        b /= 2;
        c /= 2;
        d /= 2;
        e /= 2;
        f /= 2;
        g /= 2;
        long result = a + b + c + d + e + f + g;
        return result;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
