# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap;
public class JavapProcess extends AbstractProcess {
    private Path executablePath;
    private final String EXECUTABLE_NAME = "javap" + getExecutableSuffix();
    public JavapProcess(Path executablePath) {
        this.executablePath = executablePath;
        logger.info("JavapProcess({})", executablePath);
    }
    public JavapProcess() throws FileNotFoundException {
        super();
        Path javaHome = Paths.get(System.getProperty("java.home"));
        executablePath = Paths.get(javaHome.toString(), "..", "bin", EXECUTABLE_NAME);
        if (!executablePath.toFile().exists()) {
            executablePath = Paths.get(javaHome.toString(), "bin", EXECUTABLE_NAME);
            if (!executablePath.toFile().exists()) {
                executablePath = Paths.get(System.getenv("JAVA_HOME"), "bin", EXECUTABLE_NAME);
                if (!executablePath.toFile().exists()) {
                    throw new FileNotFoundException("Could not find " + EXECUTABLE_NAME);
                }
            }
        }
        executablePath = executablePath.normalize();
        logger.info("JavapProcess() executablePath: {}", executablePath);
    }
    private List<String> getJavapCommands(Collection<String> classLocations, String fqClassName) {
        String[] args;
        if (classLocations == null || classLocations.isEmpty()) {
            args = new String[] { "-c", "-p", "-v", fqClassName };
        } else {
            StringBuilder classPathBuilder = new StringBuilder();
            for (String cp : classLocations) {
                classPathBuilder.append(cp).append(File.pathSeparatorChar);
            }
            classPathBuilder.deleteCharAt(classPathBuilder.length() - 1);
            args = new String[] { "-c", "-p", "-v", "-classpath", classPathBuilder.toString(), fqClassName };
        }
        List<String> commands = new ArrayList<>();
        commands.add(executablePath.toString());
        commands.addAll(Arrays.asList(args));
        return commands;
    }
    public boolean execute(Collection<String> classLocations, String fqClassName, Map<String, String> environment) throws IOException {
        List<String> commands = getJavapCommands(classLocations, fqClassName);
        return runCommands(commands, environment, null);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
