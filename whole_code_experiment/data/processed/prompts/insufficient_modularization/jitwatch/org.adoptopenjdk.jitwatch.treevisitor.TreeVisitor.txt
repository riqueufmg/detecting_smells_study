# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.treevisitor;
public final class TreeVisitor {
    private TreeVisitor() {
    }
    public static void walkTree(IReadOnlyJITDataModel model, ITreeVisitable visitable) {
        visitable.reset();
        List<MetaPackage> roots = model.getPackageManager().getRootPackages();
        for (MetaPackage mp : roots) {
            walkPackage(mp, visitable);
        }
    }
    private static void walkPackage(MetaPackage mp, ITreeVisitable visitable) {
        List<MetaPackage> childPackages = mp.getChildPackages();
        for (MetaPackage childPackage : childPackages) {
            walkPackage(childPackage, visitable);
        }
        List<MetaClass> packageClasses = mp.getPackageClasses();
        for (MetaClass mc : packageClasses) {
            for (IMetaMember mm : mc.getMetaMembers()) {
                visitable.visit(mm);
            }
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
