# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview;
public class TriViewNavigationStack {
    private boolean isCtrlPressed = false;
    private Deque<IMetaMember> navigationStack = new LinkedList<>();
    private TriView triView;
    public TriViewNavigationStack(final TriView triView, final Scene scene) {
        this.triView = triView;
        scene.setOnKeyPressed(new EventHandler<KeyEvent>() {
            @Override
            public void handle(KeyEvent event) {
                KeyCode code = event.getCode();
                if (code == KeyCode.CONTROL) {
                    isCtrlPressed = true;
                }
            }
        });
        scene.setOnKeyReleased(new EventHandler<KeyEvent>() {
            @Override
            public void handle(KeyEvent event) {
                KeyCode code = event.getCode();
                if (code == KeyCode.CONTROL) {
                    isCtrlPressed = false;
                } else if (code == KeyCode.BACK_SPACE) {
                    if (!navigationStack.isEmpty()) {
                        IMetaMember previous = navigationStack.pop();
                        triView.setMember(previous, false);
                    }
                }
            }
        });
    }
    public void navigateTo(IMetaMember nextMember) {
        if (nextMember != null) {
            IMetaMember currentMember = triView.getMetaMember();
            if (currentMember != null) {
                navigationStack.push(currentMember);
            }
            triView.setMember(nextMember, false);
        }
    }
    public boolean isCtrlPressed() {
        return isCtrlPressed;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
