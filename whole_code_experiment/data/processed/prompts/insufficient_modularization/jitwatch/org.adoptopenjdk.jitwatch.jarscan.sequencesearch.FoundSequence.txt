# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch;
public class FoundSequence {
    private int startingBCI;
    private MemberSignatureParts msp;
    public FoundSequence(int startingBCI, MemberSignatureParts msp) {
        this.startingBCI = startingBCI;
        this.msp = msp;
    }
    public int getStartingBCI() {
        return startingBCI;
    }
    public MemberSignatureParts getMemberSignatureParts() {
        return msp;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return msp.toStringSingleLine() + " : " + startingBCI;
    }
    public int hashCode() {
        final int prime = 31;
        int result = 1;
        result = prime * result + ((msp == null) ? 0 : msp.hashCode());
        result = prime * result + startingBCI;
        return result;
    }
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        }
        if (obj == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        FoundSequence other = (FoundSequence) obj;
        if (msp == null) {
            if (other.msp != null) {
                return false;
            }
        } else if (!msp.equals(other.msp)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (startingBCI != other.startingBCI) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
