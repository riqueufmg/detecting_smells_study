# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
public class UpperCase {
    public String upper;
    public UpperCase() {
        int iterations = 10_000_000;
        String source = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, sensibus partiendo eam at.";
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        convertString(source, iterations);
        System.out.println(upper);
        System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - start);
        start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        convertCustom(source, iterations);
        System.out.println(upper);
        System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - start);
    }
    private void convertString(String source, int iterations) {
        for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
            upper = source.toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault());
        }
    }
    private void convertCustom(String source, int iterations) {
        for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
            upper = doUpper(source);
        }
    }
    private String doUpper(String source) {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        int len = source.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            char c = source.charAt(i);
            if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {
                c -= 32;
            }
            builder.append(c);
        }
        return builder.toString();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new UpperCase();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
