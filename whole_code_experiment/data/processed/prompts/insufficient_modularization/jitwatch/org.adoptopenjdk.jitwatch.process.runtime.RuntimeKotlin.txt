# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime;
public class RuntimeKotlin extends AbstractProcess implements IRuntime {
    private Path runtimePath;
    private final Path pathToRuntimeJar = Paths.get(CompilerKotlin.KOTLIN_EXECUTABLE_JAR);
    private final String RUNTIME_NAME = "java" + getExecutableSuffix();
    public RuntimeKotlin(String languageHomeDir) throws FileNotFoundException {
        super();
        runtimePath = Paths.get(System.getProperty("java.home"), "bin", RUNTIME_NAME);
        if (!runtimePath.toFile().exists()) {
            throw new FileNotFoundException("Could not find " + RUNTIME_NAME);
        }
        runtimePath = runtimePath.normalize();
    }
    public boolean execute(Path workingDir, String className, List<String> classpathEntries, List<String> vmOptions, Map<String, String> environment, ILogListener logListener) {
        List<String> commands = new ArrayList<>();
        commands.add(runtimePath.toString());
        if (vmOptions.size() > 0) {
            commands.addAll(vmOptions);
        }
        if (classpathEntries.size() > 0) {
            commands.add("-cp");
            commands.add(makeClassPath(classpathEntries));
        }
        commands.add("-jar");
        commands.add(pathToRuntimeJar.toString());
        return runCommands(commands, workingDir, environment, logListener);
    }
    public String getClassToExecute(File fileToRun) {
        return S_EMPTY;
    }
    public String getClassForTriView(File fileToRun) {
        Properties manifest = ResourceLoader.readManifestFromZip(pathToRuntimeJar.toFile());
        String mainClass = manifest.getProperty("Main-Class");
        return mainClass;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
