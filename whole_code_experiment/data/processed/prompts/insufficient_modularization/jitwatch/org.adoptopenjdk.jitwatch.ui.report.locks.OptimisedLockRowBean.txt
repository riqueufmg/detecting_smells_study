# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks;
public class OptimisedLockRowBean extends AbstractReportRowBean {
    public OptimisedLockRowBean(Report report) {
        super(report);
    }
    public String getCompilation() {
        Compilation compilation = report.getCaller().getCompilation(report.getCompilationIndex());
        return compilation != null ? compilation.getSignature() : S_EMPTY;
    }
    public String getMetaClass() {
        return report.getCaller().getMetaClass().getFullyQualifiedName();
    }
    public String getMember() {
        return report.getCaller().toStringUnqualifiedMethodName(false, false);
    }
    public String getKind() {
        return (report.getType() == ReportType.ELIMINATED_ALLOCATION_DIRECT) ? "Direct" : "Inline";
    }
    public String getOptimisationKind() {
        String kind = null;
        Object metaData = report.getMetaData();
        if (metaData instanceof String && metaData != null) {
            kind = explain((String) metaData);
        } else {
            kind = "Unknown";
        }
        return kind;
    }
    private String explain(String kind) {
        switch(kind) {
            case "non_escaping":
                return "Elided lock on non-escaping object";
            case "coarsened":
                return "Lock was coarsened";
            default:
                return kind;
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
