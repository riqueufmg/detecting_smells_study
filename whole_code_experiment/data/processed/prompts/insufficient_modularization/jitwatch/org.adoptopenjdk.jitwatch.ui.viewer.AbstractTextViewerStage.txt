# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.viewer;
public abstract class AbstractTextViewerStage extends Stage {
    private Viewer viewer;
    public AbstractTextViewerStage(final JITWatchUI parent, String title, boolean highlighting) {
        initStyle(StageStyle.DECORATED);
        viewer = new Viewer(parent, highlighting);
        setTitle(title);
        Scene scene = UserInterfaceUtil.getScene(viewer, 640, 480);
        setScene(scene);
    }
    protected void setContent(List<Label> items, int maxLineLength) {
        viewer.setContent(items);
        int x = Math.min(80, maxLineLength);
        int y = Math.min(30, items.size());
        x = Math.max(x, 20);
        y = Math.max(y, 20);
        setWidth(x * 12);
        setHeight(y * 19);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
