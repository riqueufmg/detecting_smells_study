# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
public class HotThrow {
    private Random random = new Random();
    public HotThrow() {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        String string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
        char[] chars = string.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
            int index = random.nextInt(100);
            char c = getChar(chars, index);
            builder.append(c);
        }
        System.out.println(builder.toString());
    }
    public char getChar(char[] chars, int index) {
        try {
            return chars[index];
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            return '*';
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new HotThrow();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
