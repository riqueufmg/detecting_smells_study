# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly;
public final class AssemblyUtil {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AssemblyUtil.class);
    private AssemblyUtil() {
    }
    public static long getValueFromAddress(final String address) {
        long addressValue = 0;
        if (address != null) {
            String trimmedAddress = address.trim();
            if (trimmedAddress.startsWith(S_HEX_PREFIX)) {
                trimmedAddress = trimmedAddress.substring(S_HEX_PREFIX.length());
            }
            if (trimmedAddress.endsWith(S_HEX_POSTFIX)) {
                trimmedAddress = trimmedAddress.substring(0, trimmedAddress.length() - 1);
            }
            addressValue = Long.parseLong(trimmedAddress, 16);
        }
        return addressValue;
    }
    public static IAssemblyParser getParserForArchitecture(Architecture architecture) {
        IAssemblyParser parser = null;
        if (architecture != null) {
            switch(architecture) {
                case ARM_32:
                case ARM_64:
                    parser = new AssemblyParserARM(architecture);
                    break;
                case X86_32:
                case X86_64:
                    parser = new AssemblyParserX86(architecture);
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        }
        if (parser == null) {
            logger.debug("Unknown/missing architecture: {}, defaulting to x86 assembly parser", architecture);
            parser = new AssemblyParserX86(architecture);
        }
        return parser;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
