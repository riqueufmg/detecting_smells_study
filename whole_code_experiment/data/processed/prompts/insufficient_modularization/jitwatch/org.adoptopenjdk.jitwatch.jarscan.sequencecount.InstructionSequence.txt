# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount;
public class InstructionSequence implements Comparable<InstructionSequence> {
    private List<Opcode> sequence = new ArrayList<>();
    public InstructionSequence(List<Opcode> opcodeList) {
        sequence.addAll(opcodeList);
    }
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (Opcode opcode : sequence) {
            builder.append(opcode.getMnemonic()).append(S_COMMA);
        }
        builder.delete(builder.length() - 1, builder.length());
        return builder.toString();
    }
    public Opcode getOpcodeAtIndex(int index) {
        return sequence.get(index);
    }
    public int hashCode() {
        return toString().hashCode();
    }
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return toString().equals(obj.toString());
    }
    public int compareTo(InstructionSequence o) {
        return toString().compareTo(o.toString());
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
