# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser;
public class FileChooserListSrcZip extends FileChooserList {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FileChooserList.class);
    public FileChooserListSrcZip(Stage stage, String title, List<String> items) {
        super(stage, title, items);
        Button btnAddSrcZip = UserInterfaceUtil.createButton("CONFIG_ADD_JDK_SRC");
        btnAddSrcZip.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
            @Override
            public void handle(ActionEvent e) {
                File srcZipFile = FileUtil.getJDKSourceZip();
                if (srcZipFile != null) {
                    try {
                        String srcZipPath = srcZipFile.getCanonicalPath();
                        addPathToList(srcZipPath);
                    } catch (IOException ioe) {
                        logger.error("", ioe);
                    }
                }
            }
        });
        vboxButtons.getChildren().add(btnAddSrcZip);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
