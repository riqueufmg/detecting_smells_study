# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.jsoup.internal;
public final class Functions {
    private static final Function ListFunction = key -> new ArrayList<>();
    private static final Function SetFunction = key -> new HashSet<>();
    private static final Function MapFunction = key -> new HashMap<>();
    private static final Function IdentityMapFunction = key -> new IdentityHashMap<>();
    private Functions() {
    }
    public static <T, U> Function<T, List<U>> listFunction() {
        return (Function<T, List<U>>) ListFunction;
    }
    public static <T, U> Function<T, Set<U>> setFunction() {
        return (Function<T, Set<U>>) SetFunction;
    }
    public static <T, K, V> Function<T, Map<K, V>> mapFunction() {
        return (Function<T, Map<K, V>>) MapFunction;
    }
    public static <T, K, V> Function<T, IdentityHashMap<K, V>> identityMapFunction() {
        return (Function<T, IdentityHashMap<K, V>>) IdentityMapFunction;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
