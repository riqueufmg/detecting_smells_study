# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.jsoup.parser;
public class ParseErrorList extends ArrayList<ParseError> {
    private static final int INITIAL_CAPACITY = 16;
    private final int initialCapacity;
    private final int maxSize;
    ParseErrorList(int initialCapacity, int maxSize) {
        super(initialCapacity);
        this.initialCapacity = initialCapacity;
        this.maxSize = maxSize;
    }
    ParseErrorList(ParseErrorList copy) {
        this(copy.initialCapacity, copy.maxSize);
    }
    boolean canAddError() {
        return size() < maxSize;
    }
    int getMaxSize() {
        return maxSize;
    }
    public static ParseErrorList noTracking() {
        return new ParseErrorList(0, 0);
    }
    public static ParseErrorList tracking(int maxSize) {
        return new ParseErrorList(INITIAL_CAPACITY, maxSize);
    }
    public Object clone() {
        return super.clone();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
