# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.jsoup.internal;
public class SoftPool<T> {
    final ThreadLocal<SoftReference<ArrayDeque<T>>> threadLocalStack;
    private final Supplier<T> initializer;
    static final int MaxIdle = 12;
    public SoftPool(Supplier<T> initializer) {
        this.initializer = initializer;
        this.threadLocalStack = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new SoftReference<>(new ArrayDeque<>()));
    }
    public T borrow() {
        ArrayDeque<T> stack = getStack();
        if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            return stack.pop();
        }
        return initializer.get();
    }
    public void release(T value) {
        ArrayDeque<T> stack = getStack();
        if (stack.size() < MaxIdle) {
            stack.push(value);
        }
    }
    ArrayDeque<T> getStack() {
        ArrayDeque<T> stack = threadLocalStack.get().get();
        if (stack == null) {
            stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
            threadLocalStack.set(new SoftReference<>(stack));
        }
        return stack;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
