# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package org.jsoup.helper;
public interface RequestAuthenticator {
    PasswordAuthentication authenticate(Context auth);
    class Context {
        private final URL url;
        private final Authenticator.RequestorType type;
        private final String realm;
        Context(URL url, Authenticator.RequestorType type, String realm) {
            this.url = url;
            this.type = type;
            this.realm = realm;
        }
        public URL url() {
            return url;
        }
        public Authenticator.RequestorType type() {
            return type;
        }
        public String realm() {
            return realm;
        }
        public boolean isProxy() {
            return type == Authenticator.RequestorType.PROXY;
        }
        public boolean isServer() {
            return type == Authenticator.RequestorType.SERVER;
        }
        public PasswordAuthentication credentials(String username, String password) {
            return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password.toCharArray());
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
