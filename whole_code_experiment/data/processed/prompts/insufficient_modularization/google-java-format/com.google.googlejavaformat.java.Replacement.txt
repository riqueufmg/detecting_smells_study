# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.googlejavaformat.java;
public final class Replacement {
    public static Replacement create(int startPosition, int endPosition, String replaceWith) {
        checkArgument(startPosition >= 0, "startPosition must be non-negative");
        checkArgument(startPosition <= endPosition, "startPosition cannot be after endPosition");
        return new Replacement(Range.closedOpen(startPosition, endPosition), replaceWith);
    }
    private final Range<Integer> replaceRange;
    private final String replacementString;
    private Replacement(Range<Integer> replaceRange, String replacementString) {
        this.replaceRange = checkNotNull(replaceRange, "Null replaceRange");
        this.replacementString = checkNotNull(replacementString, "Null replacementString");
    }
    public Range<Integer> getReplaceRange() {
        return replaceRange;
    }
    public String getReplacementString() {
        return replacementString;
    }
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o == this) {
            return true;
        }
        if (o instanceof Replacement) {
            Replacement that = (Replacement) o;
            return replaceRange.equals(that.getReplaceRange()) && replacementString.equals(that.getReplacementString());
        }
        return false;
    }
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(replaceRange, replacementString);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
