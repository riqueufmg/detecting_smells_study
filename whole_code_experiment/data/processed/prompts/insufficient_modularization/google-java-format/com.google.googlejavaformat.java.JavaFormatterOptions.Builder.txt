# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.googlejavaformat.java;
public abstract class JavaFormatterOptions {
    public enum Style {
        GOOGLE(1), AOSP(2);
        private final int indentationMultiplier;
        Style(int indentationMultiplier) {
            this.indentationMultiplier = indentationMultiplier;
        }
        int indentationMultiplier() {
            return indentationMultiplier;
        }
    }
    public int indentationMultiplier() {
        return style().indentationMultiplier();
    }
    public abstract boolean formatJavadoc();
    public abstract boolean reorderModifiers();
    public abstract Style style();
    public static JavaFormatterOptions defaultOptions() {
        return builder().build();
    }
    public static Builder builder() {
        return new AutoValue_JavaFormatterOptions.Builder().style(Style.GOOGLE).formatJavadoc(true).reorderModifiers(true);
    }
    public abstract static class Builder {
        public abstract Builder style(Style style);
        public abstract Builder formatJavadoc(boolean formatJavadoc);
        public abstract Builder reorderModifiers(boolean reorderModifiers);
        public abstract JavaFormatterOptions build();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
