# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.googlejavaformat;
public abstract class Indent {
    abstract int eval();
    public static final class Const extends Indent {
        private final int n;
        public static final Const ZERO = new Const(+0);
        private Const(int n) {
            this.n = n;
        }
        public static Const make(int n, int indentMultiplier) {
            return new Const(n * indentMultiplier);
        }
        int eval() {
            return n;
        }
        public String toString() {
            return MoreObjects.toStringHelper(this).add("n", n).toString();
        }
    }
    public static final class If extends Indent {
        private final BreakTag condition;
        private final Indent thenIndent;
        private final Indent elseIndent;
        private If(BreakTag condition, Indent thenIndent, Indent elseIndent) {
            this.condition = condition;
            this.thenIndent = thenIndent;
            this.elseIndent = elseIndent;
        }
        public static If make(BreakTag condition, Indent thenIndent, Indent elseIndent) {
            return new If(condition, thenIndent, elseIndent);
        }
        int eval() {
            return (condition.wasBreakTaken() ? thenIndent : elseIndent).eval();
        }
        public String toString() {
            return MoreObjects.toStringHelper(this).add("condition", condition).add("thenIndent", thenIndent).add("elseIndent", elseIndent).toString();
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
