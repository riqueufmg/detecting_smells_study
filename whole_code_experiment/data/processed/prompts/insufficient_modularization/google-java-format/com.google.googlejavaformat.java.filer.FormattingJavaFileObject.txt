# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.googlejavaformat.java.filer;
final class FormattingJavaFileObject extends ForwardingJavaFileObject<JavaFileObject> {
    private static final int DEFAULT_FILE_SIZE = 80 * 500;
    private final Formatter formatter;
    private final Messager messager;
    FormattingJavaFileObject(JavaFileObject delegate, Formatter formatter, @Nullable Messager messager) {
        super(checkNotNull(delegate));
        this.formatter = checkNotNull(formatter);
        this.messager = messager;
    }
    public Writer openWriter() throws IOException {
        final StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(DEFAULT_FILE_SIZE);
        return new Writer() {
            @Override
            public void write(char[] chars, int start, int end) throws IOException {
                stringBuilder.append(chars, start, end - start);
            }
            @Override
            public void write(String string) throws IOException {
                stringBuilder.append(string);
            }
            @Override
            public void flush() throws IOException {
            }
            @Override
            public void close() throws IOException {
                try {
                    formatter.formatSource(CharSource.wrap(stringBuilder), new CharSink() {
                        @Override
                        public Writer openStream() throws IOException {
                            return fileObject.openWriter();
                        }
                    });
                } catch (FormatterException e) {
                    try (Writer writer = fileObject.openWriter()) {
                        writer.append(stringBuilder.toString());
                    }
                    if (messager != null) {
                        messager.printMessage(Diagnostic.Kind.NOTE, "Error formatting " + getName());
                    }
                }
            }
        };
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
