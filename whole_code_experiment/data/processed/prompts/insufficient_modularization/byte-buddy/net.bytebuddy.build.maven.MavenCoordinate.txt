# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.build.maven;
public class MavenCoordinate {
    private final String groupId;
    private final String artifactId;
    private final String version;
    private final String packaging;
    protected MavenCoordinate(String groupId, String artifactId, String version, String packaging) {
        this.groupId = groupId;
        this.artifactId = artifactId;
        this.version = version;
        this.packaging = packaging;
    }
    public Artifact asArtifact() {
        return new DefaultArtifact(groupId, artifactId, packaging, version);
    }
    public boolean equals(@MaybeNull Object object) {
        if (this == object) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(object instanceof MavenCoordinate)) {
            return false;
        }
        MavenCoordinate that = (MavenCoordinate) object;
        return groupId.equals(that.groupId) && artifactId.equals(that.artifactId) && version.equals(that.version) && packaging.equals(that.packaging);
    }
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = groupId.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + artifactId.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + version.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + packaging.hashCode();
        return result;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "MavenCoordinate{" + "groupId='" + groupId + '\'' + ", artifactId='" + artifactId + '\'' + ", version='" + version + '\'' + ", packaging='" + packaging + '\'' + '}';
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
