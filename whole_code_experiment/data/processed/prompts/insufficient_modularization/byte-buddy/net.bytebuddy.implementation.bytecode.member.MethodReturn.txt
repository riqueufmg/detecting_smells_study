# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.member;
public enum MethodReturn implements StackManipulation {
    INTEGER(Opcodes.IRETURN, StackSize.SINGLE),
    DOUBLE(Opcodes.DRETURN, StackSize.DOUBLE),
    FLOAT(Opcodes.FRETURN, StackSize.SINGLE),
    LONG(Opcodes.LRETURN, StackSize.DOUBLE),
    VOID(Opcodes.RETURN, StackSize.ZERO),
    REFERENCE(Opcodes.ARETURN, StackSize.SINGLE);
    private final int returnOpcode;
    private final StackSize stackSize;
    MethodReturn(int returnOpcode, StackSize stackSize) {
        this.returnOpcode = returnOpcode;
        this.stackSize = stackSize;
    }
    public static StackManipulation of(TypeDefinition typeDefinition) {
        if (typeDefinition.isPrimitive()) {
            if (typeDefinition.represents(long.class)) {
                return LONG;
            } else if (typeDefinition.represents(double.class)) {
                return DOUBLE;
            } else if (typeDefinition.represents(float.class)) {
                return FLOAT;
            } else if (typeDefinition.represents(void.class)) {
                return VOID;
            } else {
                return INTEGER;
            }
        } else {
            return REFERENCE;
        }
    }
    public boolean isValid() {
        return true;
    }
    public Size apply(MethodVisitor methodVisitor, Implementation.Context implementationContext) {
        methodVisitor.visitInsn(returnOpcode);
        return stackSize.toDecreasingSize();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
