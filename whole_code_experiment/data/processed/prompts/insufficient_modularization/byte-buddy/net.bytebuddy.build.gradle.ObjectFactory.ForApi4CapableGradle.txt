# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.build.gradle;
public class ObjectFactory {
    private static final Dispatcher DISPATCHER;
    static {
        Dispatcher dispatcher;
        try {
            dispatcher = new Dispatcher.ForApi4CapableGradle(Project.class.getMethod("getObjects"), Class.forName("org.gradle.api.model.ObjectFactory").getMethod("newInstance", Class.class, Object[].class));
        } catch (Throwable ignored) {
            dispatcher = Dispatcher.ForLegacyGradle.INSTANCE;
        }
        DISPATCHER = dispatcher;
    }
    private ObjectFactory() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("This class is a utility class and not supposed to be instantiated");
    }
    public static <T> T newInstance(Project project, Class<T> type, Object... argument) {
        return (T) DISPATCHER.newInstance(project, type, argument);
    }
    protected interface Dispatcher {
        Object newInstance(Project project, Class<?> type, Object... argument);
        enum ForLegacyGradle implements Dispatcher {
            INSTANCE;
            public Object newInstance(Project project, Class<?> type, Object... argument) {
                return null;
            }
        }
        class ForApi4CapableGradle implements Dispatcher {
            private final Method getObjects;
            private final Method newInstance;
            protected ForApi4CapableGradle(Method getObjects, Method newInstance) {
                this.getObjects = getObjects;
                this.newInstance = newInstance;
            }
            public Object newInstance(Project project, Class<?> type, Object... argument) {
                try {
                    return newInstance.invoke(getObjects.invoke(project), type, argument);
                } catch (IllegalAccessException exception) {
                    throw new IllegalStateException(exception);
                } catch (InvocationTargetException exception) {
                    Throwable cause = exception.getCause();
                    if (cause instanceof RuntimeException) {
                        throw (RuntimeException) cause;
                    } else if (cause instanceof Error) {
                        throw (Error) cause;
                    } else {
                        throw new RuntimeException(exception);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
