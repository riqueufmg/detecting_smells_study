# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.implementation;
public interface MethodAccessorFactory {
    MethodDescription.InDefinedShape registerAccessorFor(Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation specialMethodInvocation, AccessType accessType);
    MethodDescription.InDefinedShape registerGetterFor(FieldDescription fieldDescription, AccessType accessType);
    MethodDescription.InDefinedShape registerSetterFor(FieldDescription fieldDescription, AccessType accessType);
    enum AccessType {
        PUBLIC(Visibility.PUBLIC), DEFAULT(Visibility.PACKAGE_PRIVATE);
        private final Visibility visibility;
        AccessType(Visibility visibility) {
            this.visibility = visibility;
        }
        public Visibility getVisibility() {
            return visibility;
        }
    }
    enum Illegal implements MethodAccessorFactory {
        INSTANCE;
        public MethodDescription.InDefinedShape registerAccessorFor(Implementation.SpecialMethodInvocation specialMethodInvocation, AccessType accessType) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("It is illegal to register an accessor for this type");
        }
        public MethodDescription.InDefinedShape registerGetterFor(FieldDescription fieldDescription, AccessType accessType) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("It is illegal to register a field getter for this type");
        }
        public MethodDescription.InDefinedShape registerSetterFor(FieldDescription fieldDescription, AccessType accessType) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("It is illegal to register a field setter for this type");
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
