# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode;
public enum Removal implements StackManipulation {
    ZERO(StackSize.ZERO, Opcodes.NOP) {
        public Size apply(MethodVisitor methodVisitor, Implementation.Context implementationContext) {
            return Size.ZERO;
        }
    }
    , SINGLE(StackSize.SINGLE, Opcodes.POP), DOUBLE(StackSize.DOUBLE, Opcodes.POP2);
    private final Size size;
    private final int opcode;
    Removal(StackSize stackSize, int opcode) {
        size = stackSize.toDecreasingSize();
        this.opcode = opcode;
    }
    public static StackManipulation of(TypeDefinition typeDefinition) {
        switch(typeDefinition.getStackSize()) {
            case SINGLE:
                return SINGLE;
            case DOUBLE:
                return DOUBLE;
            case ZERO:
                return ZERO;
            default:
                throw new AssertionError();
        }
    }
    public boolean isValid() {
        return true;
    }
    public Size apply(MethodVisitor methodVisitor, Implementation.Context implementationContext) {
        methodVisitor.visitInsn(opcode);
        return size;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
