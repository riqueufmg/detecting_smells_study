# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.matcher;
public class HasSuperTypeMatcher<T extends TypeDescription> extends ElementMatcher.Junction.ForNonNullValues<T> {
    private final ElementMatcher<? super TypeDescription.Generic> matcher;
    public HasSuperTypeMatcher(ElementMatcher<? super TypeDescription.Generic> matcher) {
        this.matcher = matcher;
    }
    protected boolean doMatch(T target) {
        Set<TypeDescription> previous = new HashSet<TypeDescription>();
        for (TypeDefinition typeDefinition : target) {
            if (!previous.add(typeDefinition.asErasure())) {
                return false;
            } else if (matcher.matches(typeDefinition.asGenericType())) {
                return true;
            }
            Queue<TypeDefinition> interfaceTypes = QueueFactory.<TypeDefinition>make(typeDefinition.getInterfaces());
            while (!interfaceTypes.isEmpty()) {
                TypeDefinition interfaceType = interfaceTypes.remove();
                if (previous.add(interfaceType.asErasure())) {
                    if (matcher.matches(interfaceType.asGenericType())) {
                        return true;
                    } else {
                        interfaceTypes.addAll(interfaceType.getInterfaces());
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "hasSuperType(" + matcher + ")";
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
