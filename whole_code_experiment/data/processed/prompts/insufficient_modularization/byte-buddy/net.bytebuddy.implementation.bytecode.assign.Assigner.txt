# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign;
public interface Assigner {
    Assigner DEFAULT = new VoidAwareAssigner(new PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner(ReferenceTypeAwareAssigner.INSTANCE));
    Assigner GENERICS_AWARE = new VoidAwareAssigner(new PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner(GenericTypeAwareAssigner.INSTANCE));
    StackManipulation assign(TypeDescription.Generic source, TypeDescription.Generic target, Typing typing);
    enum Typing {
        STATIC(false), DYNAMIC(true);
        private final boolean dynamic;
        Typing(boolean dynamic) {
            this.dynamic = dynamic;
        }
        public static Typing of(boolean dynamic) {
            return dynamic ? DYNAMIC : STATIC;
        }
        public boolean isDynamic() {
            return dynamic;
        }
    }
    enum EqualTypesOnly implements Assigner {
        GENERIC {
            public StackManipulation assign(TypeDescription.Generic source, TypeDescription.Generic target, Typing typing) {
                return source.equals(target) ? StackManipulation.Trivial.INSTANCE : StackManipulation.Illegal.INSTANCE;
            }
        }
        , ERASURE {
            public StackManipulation assign(TypeDescription.Generic source, TypeDescription.Generic target, Typing typing) {
                return source.asErasure().equals(target.asErasure()) ? StackManipulation.Trivial.INSTANCE : StackManipulation.Illegal.INSTANCE;
            }
        }
    }
    enum Refusing implements Assigner {
        INSTANCE;
        public StackManipulation assign(TypeDescription.Generic source, TypeDescription.Generic target, Typing typing) {
            return StackManipulation.Illegal.INSTANCE;
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
