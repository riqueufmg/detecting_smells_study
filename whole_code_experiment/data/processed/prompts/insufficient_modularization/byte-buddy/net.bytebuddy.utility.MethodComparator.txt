# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.utility;
public enum MethodComparator implements Comparator<Method> {
    INSTANCE;
    public int compare(Method left, Method right) {
        if (left == right) {
            return 0;
        }
        int comparison = left.getName().compareTo(right.getName());
        if (comparison == 0) {
            Class<?>[] leftParameterType = left.getParameterTypes(), rightParameterType = right.getParameterTypes();
            if (leftParameterType.length < rightParameterType.length) {
                return -1;
            } else if (leftParameterType.length > rightParameterType.length) {
                return 1;
            } else {
                for (int index = 0; index < leftParameterType.length; index++) {
                    int comparisonParameterType = leftParameterType[index].getName().compareTo(rightParameterType[index].getName());
                    if (comparisonParameterType != 0) {
                        return comparisonParameterType;
                    }
                }
                return left.getReturnType().getName().compareTo(right.getReturnType().getName());
            }
        } else {
            return comparison;
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
