# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.description.modifier;
public enum Visibility implements ModifierContributor.ForType, ModifierContributor.ForMethod, ModifierContributor.ForField {
    PUBLIC(Opcodes.ACC_PUBLIC), PACKAGE_PRIVATE(EMPTY_MASK), PROTECTED(Opcodes.ACC_PROTECTED), PRIVATE(Opcodes.ACC_PRIVATE);
    private final int mask;
    Visibility(int mask) {
        this.mask = mask;
    }
    public int getMask() {
        return mask;
    }
    public int getRange() {
        return Opcodes.ACC_PUBLIC | Opcodes.ACC_PROTECTED | Opcodes.ACC_PRIVATE;
    }
    public boolean isDefault() {
        return this == PACKAGE_PRIVATE;
    }
    public boolean isPublic() {
        return (mask & Opcodes.ACC_PUBLIC) != 0;
    }
    public boolean isProtected() {
        return (mask & Opcodes.ACC_PROTECTED) != 0;
    }
    public boolean isPackagePrivate() {
        return !(isPublic() || isPrivate() || isProtected());
    }
    public boolean isPrivate() {
        return (mask & Opcodes.ACC_PRIVATE) != 0;
    }
    public Visibility expandTo(Visibility visibility) {
        switch(visibility) {
            case PUBLIC:
                return PUBLIC;
            case PROTECTED:
                return this == PUBLIC ? PUBLIC : visibility;
            case PACKAGE_PRIVATE:
                return this == PRIVATE ? PACKAGE_PRIVATE : this;
            case PRIVATE:
                return this;
            default:
                throw new IllegalStateException("Unexpected visibility: " + visibility);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
