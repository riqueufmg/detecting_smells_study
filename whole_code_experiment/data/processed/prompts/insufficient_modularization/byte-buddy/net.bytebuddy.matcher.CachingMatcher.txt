# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.matcher;
public class CachingMatcher<T> extends ElementMatcher.Junction.AbstractBase<T> {
    private static final Object NULL_VALUE = new Object();
    private final ElementMatcher<? super T> matcher;
    protected final ConcurrentMap<? super T, Boolean> map;
    public CachingMatcher(ElementMatcher<? super T> matcher, ConcurrentMap<? super T, Boolean> map) {
        this.matcher = matcher;
        this.map = map;
    }
    public boolean matches(@MaybeNull T target) {
        Boolean cached = map.get(target == null ? NULL_VALUE : target);
        if (cached == null) {
            cached = onCacheMiss(target);
        }
        return cached;
    }
    protected boolean onCacheMiss(@MaybeNull T target) {
        boolean cached = matcher.matches(target);
        map.put(target == null ? (T) NULL_VALUE : target, cached);
        return cached;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "cached(" + matcher + ")";
    }
    public static class WithInlineEviction<S> extends CachingMatcher<S> {
        private final int evictionSize;
        public WithInlineEviction(ElementMatcher<? super S> matcher, ConcurrentMap<? super S, Boolean> map, int evictionSize) {
            super(matcher, map);
            this.evictionSize = evictionSize;
        }
        protected boolean onCacheMiss(@MaybeNull S target) {
            if (map.size() >= evictionSize) {
                Iterator<?> iterator = map.entrySet().iterator();
                iterator.next();
                iterator.remove();
            }
            return super.onCacheMiss(target);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
