# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.utility;
public class QueueFactory {
    private static final QueueFactory INSTANCE = new QueueFactory();
    private final Dispatcher dispatcher;
    private QueueFactory() {
        dispatcher = doPrivileged(JavaDispatcher.of(Dispatcher.class));
    }
    public static <T> Queue<T> make() {
        Queue<T> queue = INSTANCE.dispatcher.arrayDeque();
        return queue == null ? new LinkedList<T>() : queue;
    }
    public static <T> Queue<T> make(Collection<? extends T> elements) {
        Queue<T> queue = INSTANCE.dispatcher.arrayDeque(elements);
        return queue == null ? new LinkedList<T>(elements) : queue;
    }
    private static <T> T doPrivileged(PrivilegedAction<T> action) {
        return action.run();
    }
    protected interface Dispatcher {
        <T> Queue<T> arrayDeque();
        <T> Queue<T> arrayDeque(Collection<? extends T> elements);
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
