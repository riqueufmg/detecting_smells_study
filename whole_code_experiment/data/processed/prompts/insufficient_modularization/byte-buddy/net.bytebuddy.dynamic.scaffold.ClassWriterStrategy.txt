# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold;
public interface ClassWriterStrategy {
    ClassWriter resolve(int flags, TypePool typePool);
    ClassWriter resolve(int flags, TypePool typePool, ClassReader classReader);
    enum Default implements ClassWriterStrategy {
        CONSTANT_POOL_RETAINING {
            public ClassWriter resolve(int flags, TypePool typePool, ClassReader classReader) {
                return new FrameComputingClassWriter(classReader, flags, typePool);
            }
        }
        , CONSTANT_POOL_DISCARDING {
            public ClassWriter resolve(int flags, TypePool typePool, ClassReader classReader) {
                return resolve(flags, typePool);
            }
        }
        ;
        public ClassWriter resolve(int flags, TypePool typePool) {
            return new FrameComputingClassWriter(flags, typePool);
        }
    }
    class Delegating implements AsmClassWriter.Factory {
        private final ClassWriterStrategy classWriterStrategy;
        public Delegating(ClassWriterStrategy classWriterStrategy) {
            this.classWriterStrategy = classWriterStrategy;
        }
        public AsmClassWriter make(int flags) {
            return make(flags, TypePool.Empty.INSTANCE);
        }
        public AsmClassWriter make(int flags, AsmClassReader classReader) {
            return make(flags, classReader, TypePool.Empty.INSTANCE);
        }
        public AsmClassWriter make(int flags, TypePool typePool) {
            return new AsmClassWriter.ForAsm(classWriterStrategy.resolve(flags, typePool));
        }
        public AsmClassWriter make(int flags, AsmClassReader classReader, TypePool typePool) {
            ClassReader unwrapped = classReader.unwrap(ClassReader.class);
            return new AsmClassWriter.ForAsm(unwrapped == null ? classWriterStrategy.resolve(flags, typePool) : classWriterStrategy.resolve(flags, typePool, unwrapped));
        }
    }
    class FrameComputingClassWriter extends AsmClassWriter.FrameComputingClassWriter {
        public FrameComputingClassWriter(int flags, TypePool typePool) {
            super(flags, typePool);
        }
        public FrameComputingClassWriter(ClassReader classReader, int flags, TypePool typePool) {
            super(classReader, flags, typePool);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
