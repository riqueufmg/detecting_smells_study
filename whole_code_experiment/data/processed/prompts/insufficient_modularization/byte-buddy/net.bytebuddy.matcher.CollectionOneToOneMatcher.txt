# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.matcher;
public class CollectionOneToOneMatcher<T> extends ElementMatcher.Junction.ForNonNullValues<Iterable<? extends T>> {
    private final List<? extends ElementMatcher<? super T>> matchers;
    public CollectionOneToOneMatcher(List<? extends ElementMatcher<? super T>> matchers) {
        this.matchers = matchers;
    }
    protected boolean doMatch(Iterable<? extends T> target) {
        if ((target instanceof Collection) && ((Collection<?>) target).size() != matchers.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        Iterator<? extends ElementMatcher<? super T>> iterator = matchers.iterator();
        for (T value : target) {
            if (!iterator.hasNext() || !iterator.next().matches(value)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("containing(");
        boolean first = true;
        for (Object value : matchers) {
            if (first) {
                first = false;
            } else {
                stringBuilder.append(", ");
            }
            stringBuilder.append(value);
        }
        return stringBuilder.append(')').toString();
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
