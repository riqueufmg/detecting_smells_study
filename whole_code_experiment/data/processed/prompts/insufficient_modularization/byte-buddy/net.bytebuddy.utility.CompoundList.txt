# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.utility;
public class CompoundList {
    private CompoundList() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("This class is a utility class and not supposed to be instantiated");
    }
    public static <S> List<S> of(S left, List<? extends S> right) {
        if (right.isEmpty()) {
            return Collections.singletonList(left);
        } else {
            List<S> list = new ArrayList<S>(1 + right.size());
            list.add(left);
            list.addAll(right);
            return list;
        }
    }
    public static <S> List<S> of(List<? extends S> left, S right) {
        if (left.isEmpty()) {
            return Collections.singletonList(right);
        } else {
            List<S> list = new ArrayList<S>(left.size() + 1);
            list.addAll(left);
            list.add(right);
            return list;
        }
    }
    public static <S> List<S> of(List<? extends S> left, List<? extends S> right) {
        List<S> list = new ArrayList<S>(left.size() + right.size());
        list.addAll(left);
        list.addAll(right);
        return list;
    }
    public static <S> List<S> of(List<? extends S> left, List<? extends S> middle, List<? extends S> right) {
        List<S> list = new ArrayList<S>(left.size() + middle.size() + right.size());
        list.addAll(left);
        list.addAll(middle);
        list.addAll(right);
        return list;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
