# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.build.maven;
public class Initialization extends CoordinateConfiguration {
    public String entryPoint;
    public boolean validated;
    public Initialization() {
        entryPoint = EntryPoint.Default.REBASE.name();
        validated = true;
    }
    public EntryPoint getEntryPoint(ClassLoaderResolver classLoaderResolver, String groupId, String artifactId, String version, String packaging) throws MojoExecutionException {
        if (entryPoint == null || entryPoint.length() == 0) {
            throw new MojoExecutionException("Entry point name is not defined");
        }
        for (EntryPoint.Default entryPoint : EntryPoint.Default.values()) {
            if (this.entryPoint.equals(entryPoint.name())) {
                return validated ? entryPoint : new EntryPoint.Unvalidated(entryPoint);
            }
        }
        try {
            EntryPoint entryPoint = (EntryPoint) Class.forName(this.entryPoint, false, classLoaderResolver.resolve(asCoordinate(groupId, artifactId, version, packaging))).getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
            return validated ? entryPoint : new EntryPoint.Unvalidated(entryPoint);
        } catch (Exception exception) {
            throw new MojoExecutionException("Cannot create entry point: " + entryPoint, exception);
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
