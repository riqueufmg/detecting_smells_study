# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.dynamic;
public final class TargetType {
    public static final TypeDescription DESCRIPTION = TypeDescription.ForLoadedType.of(TargetType.class);
    public static TypeDescription resolve(TypeDescription typeDescription, TypeDescription targetType) {
        int arity = 0;
        TypeDescription componentType = typeDescription;
        while (componentType.isArray()) {
            componentType = componentType.getComponentType();
            arity++;
        }
        return componentType.represents(TargetType.class) ? TypeDescription.ArrayProjection.of(targetType, arity) : typeDescription;
    }
    private TargetType() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("This class only serves as a marker type and should not be instantiated");
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
