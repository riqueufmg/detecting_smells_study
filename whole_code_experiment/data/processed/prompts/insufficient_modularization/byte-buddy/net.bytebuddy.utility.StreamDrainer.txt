# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.utility;
public class StreamDrainer {
    public static final int DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE = 1024;
    public static final StreamDrainer DEFAULT = new StreamDrainer();
    private static final int END_OF_STREAM = -1;
    private static final int FROM_BEGINNING = 0;
    private final int bufferSize;
    public StreamDrainer() {
        this(DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE);
    }
    public StreamDrainer(int bufferSize) {
        this.bufferSize = bufferSize;
    }
    public byte[] drain(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        List<byte[]> previousBytes = new ArrayList<byte[]>();
        byte[] currentArray = new byte[bufferSize];
        int currentIndex = 0;
        int currentRead;
        do {
            currentRead = inputStream.read(currentArray, currentIndex, bufferSize - currentIndex);
            currentIndex += Math.max(currentRead, 0);
            if (currentIndex == bufferSize) {
                previousBytes.add(currentArray);
                currentArray = new byte[bufferSize];
                currentIndex = 0;
            }
        } while (currentRead != END_OF_STREAM);
        byte[] result = new byte[previousBytes.size() * bufferSize + currentIndex];
        int arrayIndex = 0;
        for (byte[] previousByte : previousBytes) {
            System.arraycopy(previousByte, FROM_BEGINNING, result, arrayIndex++ * bufferSize, bufferSize);
        }
        System.arraycopy(currentArray, FROM_BEGINNING, result, arrayIndex * bufferSize, currentIndex);
        return result;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
