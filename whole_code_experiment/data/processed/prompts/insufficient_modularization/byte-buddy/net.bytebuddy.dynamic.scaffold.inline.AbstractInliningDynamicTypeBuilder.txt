# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.inline;
public abstract class AbstractInliningDynamicTypeBuilder<T> extends DynamicType.Builder.AbstractBase.Adapter<T> {
    protected final TypeDescription originalType;
    protected final ClassFileLocator classFileLocator;
    protected AbstractInliningDynamicTypeBuilder(InstrumentedType.WithFlexibleName instrumentedType, FieldRegistry fieldRegistry, MethodRegistry methodRegistry, RecordComponentRegistry recordComponentRegistry, TypeAttributeAppender typeAttributeAppender, AsmVisitorWrapper asmVisitorWrapper, ClassFileVersion classFileVersion, AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy auxiliaryTypeNamingStrategy, AnnotationValueFilter.Factory annotationValueFilterFactory, AnnotationRetention annotationRetention, Implementation.Context.Factory implementationContextFactory, MethodGraph.Compiler methodGraphCompiler, TypeValidation typeValidation, VisibilityBridgeStrategy visibilityBridgeStrategy, AsmClassReader.Factory classReaderFactory, AsmClassWriter.Factory classWriterFactory, LatentMatcher<? super MethodDescription> ignoredMethods, List<? extends DynamicType> auxiliaryTypes, TypeDescription originalType, ClassFileLocator classFileLocator) {
        super(instrumentedType, fieldRegistry, methodRegistry, recordComponentRegistry, typeAttributeAppender, asmVisitorWrapper, classFileVersion, auxiliaryTypeNamingStrategy, annotationValueFilterFactory, annotationRetention, implementationContextFactory, methodGraphCompiler, typeValidation, visibilityBridgeStrategy, classReaderFactory, classWriterFactory, ignoredMethods, auxiliaryTypes);
        this.originalType = originalType;
        this.classFileLocator = classFileLocator;
    }
    protected TypeWriter<T> toTypeWriter() {
        return toTypeWriter(TypePool.Default.of(classFileLocator));
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
