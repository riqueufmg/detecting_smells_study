# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.build.maven;
public class CoordinateConfiguration {
    protected String groupId;
    protected String artifactId;
    protected String version;
    protected String packaging;
    protected String getGroupId(String groupId) {
        return this.groupId == null || this.groupId.length() == 0 ? groupId : this.groupId;
    }
    protected String getArtifactId(String artifactId) {
        return this.artifactId == null || this.artifactId.length() == 0 ? artifactId : this.artifactId;
    }
    protected String getVersion(String version) {
        return this.version == null || this.version.length() == 0 ? version : this.version;
    }
    protected String getPackaging(String packaging) {
        return this.packaging == null || this.packaging.length() == 0 ? packaging : this.packaging;
    }
    protected MavenCoordinate asCoordinate(String groupId, String artifactId, String version, String packaging) {
        return new MavenCoordinate(getGroupId(groupId), getArtifactId(artifactId), getVersion(version), getPackaging(packaging));
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
