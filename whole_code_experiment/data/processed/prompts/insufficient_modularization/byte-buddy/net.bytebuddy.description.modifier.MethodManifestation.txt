# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.description.modifier;
public enum MethodManifestation implements ModifierContributor.ForMethod {
    PLAIN(EMPTY_MASK),
    NATIVE(Opcodes.ACC_NATIVE),
    ABSTRACT(Opcodes.ACC_ABSTRACT),
    FINAL(Opcodes.ACC_FINAL),
    FINAL_NATIVE(Opcodes.ACC_FINAL | Opcodes.ACC_NATIVE),
    BRIDGE(Opcodes.ACC_BRIDGE),
    FINAL_BRIDGE(Opcodes.ACC_FINAL | Opcodes.ACC_BRIDGE);
    private final int mask;
    MethodManifestation(int mask) {
        this.mask = mask;
    }
    public int getMask() {
        return mask;
    }
    public int getRange() {
        return Opcodes.ACC_NATIVE | Opcodes.ACC_ABSTRACT | Opcodes.ACC_FINAL | Opcodes.ACC_BRIDGE;
    }
    public boolean isDefault() {
        return this == PLAIN;
    }
    public boolean isNative() {
        return (mask & Opcodes.ACC_NATIVE) != 0;
    }
    public boolean isAbstract() {
        return (mask & Opcodes.ACC_ABSTRACT) != 0;
    }
    public boolean isFinal() {
        return (mask & Opcodes.ACC_FINAL) != 0;
    }
    public boolean isBridge() {
        return (mask & Opcodes.ACC_BRIDGE) != 0;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
