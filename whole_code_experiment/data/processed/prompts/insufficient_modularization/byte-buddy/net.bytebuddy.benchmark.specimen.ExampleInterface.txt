# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen;
public interface ExampleInterface {
    boolean method(boolean arg);
    byte method(byte arg);
    short method(short arg);
    int method(int arg);
    char method(char arg);
    long method(long arg);
    float method(float arg);
    double method(double arg);
    Object method(Object arg);
    boolean[] method(boolean arg1, boolean arg2, boolean arg3);
    byte[] method(byte arg1, byte arg2, byte arg3);
    short[] method(short arg1, short arg2, short arg3);
    int[] method(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3);
    char[] method(char arg1, char arg2, char arg3);
    long[] method(long arg1, long arg2, long arg3);
    float[] method(float arg1, float arg2, float arg3);
    double[] method(double arg1, double arg2, double arg3);
    Object[] method(Object arg1, Object arg2, Object arg3);
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
