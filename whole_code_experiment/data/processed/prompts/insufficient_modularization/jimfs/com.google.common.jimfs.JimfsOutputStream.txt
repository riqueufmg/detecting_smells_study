# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.common.jimfs;
final class JimfsOutputStream extends OutputStream {
    RegularFile file;
    private long pos;
    private final boolean append;
    private final FileSystemState fileSystemState;
    JimfsOutputStream(RegularFile file, boolean append, FileSystemState fileSystemState) {
        this.file = checkNotNull(file);
        this.append = append;
        this.fileSystemState = fileSystemState;
        fileSystemState.register(this);
    }
    public synchronized void write(int b) throws IOException {
        checkNotClosed();
        file.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            if (append) {
                pos = file.sizeWithoutLocking();
            }
            file.write(pos++, (byte) b);
            file.setLastModifiedTime(fileSystemState.now());
        } finally {
            file.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
    public void write(byte[] b) throws IOException {
        writeInternal(b, 0, b.length);
    }
    public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
        checkPositionIndexes(off, off + len, b.length);
        writeInternal(b, off, len);
    }
    private synchronized void writeInternal(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
        checkNotClosed();
        file.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            if (append) {
                pos = file.sizeWithoutLocking();
            }
            pos += file.write(pos, b, off, len);
            file.setLastModifiedTime(fileSystemState.now());
        } finally {
            file.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
    private void checkNotClosed() throws IOException {
        if (file == null) {
            throw new IOException("stream is closed");
        }
    }
    public synchronized void close() throws IOException {
        if (isOpen()) {
            fileSystemState.unregister(this);
            file.closed();
            file = null;
        }
    }
    private boolean isOpen() {
        return file != null;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
