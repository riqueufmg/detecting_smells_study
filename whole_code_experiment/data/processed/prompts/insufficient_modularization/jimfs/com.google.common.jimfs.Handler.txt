# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.common.jimfs;
public final class Handler extends URLStreamHandler {
    private static final String JAVA_PROTOCOL_HANDLER_PACKAGES = "java.protocol.handler.pkgs";
    static void register() {
        register(Handler.class);
    }
    static void register(Class<? extends URLStreamHandler> handlerClass) {
        checkArgument("Handler".equals(handlerClass.getSimpleName()));
        String pkg = handlerClass.getPackage().getName();
        int lastDot = pkg.lastIndexOf('.');
        checkArgument(lastDot > 0, "package for Handler (%s) must have a parent package", pkg);
        String parentPackage = pkg.substring(0, lastDot);
        String packages = System.getProperty(JAVA_PROTOCOL_HANDLER_PACKAGES);
        if (packages == null) {
            packages = parentPackage;
        } else {
            packages += "|" + parentPackage;
        }
        System.setProperty(JAVA_PROTOCOL_HANDLER_PACKAGES, packages);
    }
    @Deprecated
    public Handler() {
    }
    protected URLConnection openConnection(URL url) throws IOException {
        return new PathURLConnection(url);
    }
    protected InetAddress getHostAddress(URL url) {
        return null;
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
