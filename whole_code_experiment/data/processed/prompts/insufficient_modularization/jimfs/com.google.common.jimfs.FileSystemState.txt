# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis should happen in the class provided in the **##Input** field.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

Assess whether the following class has the smell Insufficient Modularization:

```java
package com.google.common.jimfs;
final class FileSystemState implements Closeable {
    private final Set<Closeable> resources = Sets.newConcurrentHashSet();
    private final FileTimeSource fileTimeSource;
    private final Runnable onClose;
    private final AtomicBoolean open = new AtomicBoolean(true);
    private final AtomicInteger registering = new AtomicInteger();
    FileSystemState(FileTimeSource fileTimeSource, Runnable onClose) {
        this.fileTimeSource = checkNotNull(fileTimeSource);
        this.onClose = checkNotNull(onClose);
    }
    public boolean isOpen() {
        return open.get();
    }
    public void checkOpen() {
        if (!open.get()) {
            throw new ClosedFileSystemException();
        }
    }
    public <C extends Closeable> C register(C resource) {
        checkOpen();
        registering.incrementAndGet();
        try {
            checkOpen();
            resources.add(resource);
            return resource;
        } finally {
            registering.decrementAndGet();
        }
    }
    public void unregister(Closeable resource) {
        resources.remove(resource);
    }
    public FileTime now() {
        return fileTimeSource.now();
    }
    public void close() throws IOException {
        if (open.compareAndSet(true, false)) {
            onClose.run();
            Throwable thrown = null;
            do {
                for (Closeable resource : resources) {
                    try {
                        resource.close();
                    } catch (Throwable e) {
                        if (thrown == null) {
                            thrown = e;
                        } else {
                            thrown.addSuppressed(e);
                        }
                    } finally {
                        resources.remove(resource);
                    }
                }
            } while (registering.get() > 0 || !resources.isEmpty());
            if (thrown != null) {
                throwIfInstanceOf(thrown, IOException.class);
                throwIfUnchecked(thrown);
            }
        }
    }
}


```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
    "class": [class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
